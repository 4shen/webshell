# zf0 anti-copyright pledge, from zf0's third zine

    -- Introducing ZAP --
    
    Have you ever been in a situation where you based your code
    off of another script, yet you didn't want to include its
    accompanying copyright notice? Then this is for you.
    
    In this case, you have three options:
    
      a) Include the notice, because you are lazy and legal.
      b) Rewrite your program from scratch, because you want
         your due creative recognition.
      c) Simply not include the copyright notice.
    
    These are also known as:
    
      a) The lame way.
      b) The ego way.
      c) The elite way!
    
    There are various reasons for choosing c. Perhaps you find
    that if you were to start your code fresh, it would be
    similar in expressions and control to the code you had
    before. Further, they would probably do the same thing in
    almost the same way. Doing so does not seem fair to you.
    
    Additionally, by including the GPL in your modified program
    you have essentially waved moral rights to the code. You
    have signed the code over, so to speak, and have willingly
    withdrawn your rights to it.
    
    You might feel a bit ripped off. Afterall, perhaps your
    code is a greater derivation, in both form and concept,
    from your source than that source is from its influences.
    
    A more practical reason exists: Perhaps you hate long,
    annoying comments from others in your tool, and heck, you
    are an evil hacker who isn't going to let copyright law
    alter your practices.
    
    The GPL is one example of a copyleft notice that seeks to
    limit some freedoms to ensure most freedoms. As nice as the
    GPL is, for any of the reasons above you may not wish to
    abide by its rules. The GPL is not full of loopholes:
    rather, every new version is like the next Terminator, only
    stronger. It's out to get you and you cannot stop it. I
    knocked a copy of the GPLv2 into molten steel; it came out
    squeaky clean.
    
    If you decide to basically violate the law and not include
    a copyright license, you may wish to offer some explanation
    for that choice. Thus, we present ZAP.

    |            ZF0 Anti-copyright Pledge (ZAP)              |

    | 1. This code may or may not be derived                  |
    |    from one or multiple external sources                |
    |    with or without express permission.                  |
    |                                                         |
    |                                                         |
    | 2. We reject the general universal applicability        |
    |    of software copyrights to all cases based on         |
    |    any combination of the following:                    |
    |                                                         |
    |     a) The vagueness of the Agreement on Trade          |
    |        -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property        |
    |        Rights in the area of software rights.           |
    |     b) The lack of cohesion of different                |
    |        national copyright legislation.                  |
    |     c) The lack of originality in software and          |
    |        the lack of establishment of originality.        |
    |     d) Further personal opinions.                       |
    |                                                         |
    |                                                         |
    | 3. We reject the assumed right of verbatim              |
    |    copyright control over all revision.                 |
    |                                                         |
    |     a) Particularly in free software, a copyright       |
    |        serves as recognition and little else.           |
    |     b) We will extend recognition as we                 |
    |        feel it is deserved, and not less.               |
    |                                                         |
    |                                                         |
    | 4. This statement does not attempt to                   |
    |    serve as a legally binding document.                 |
    |                                                         |
    |     a) This notice is an explanation, not a limitation. |
    |     b) These are terms of release,                      |
    |        not conditions of use                            |
    |     c) This software is thus provided as-is             |
    |        without any guarantees or warranties.            |
    |                                                         |
