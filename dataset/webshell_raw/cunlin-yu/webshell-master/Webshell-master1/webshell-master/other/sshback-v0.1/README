Have you ever needed to have access to an ssh server from behind
a NAT'ed firewall? Now you can. SSHBack allows you to have reverse 
ssh connections connect back to you.

Made from 100% FOSS recycled materials, this software is made to 
withstand the most demanding conditions, including, but not 
limited to: __FILL_IN_BLANK_HERE__

(For amusement purposes only. Do not abuse or misuse this product.
Do not ruin anyone's day with this software, please!)

sshback client machine: has openssh-server on
sshback sever machine: has openssh-client on

NOTE: "Server_Common_Name" must be able to DNS resolve
      on the client machine, e.g.
$ host www.servercommonname.com
www.servercommonname.com has address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

run 
$ ./sshback_make_certs.sh
to make all the certs

then move client.pem, server.crt, and sshback_client.sh to the 
  machine with openssh-server installed
make sure 'socat' is installed
chmod +x sshback_client.sh
add line to /etc/rc.local like...
/path/to/sshback_client.sh &
...to make it autorun

then move server.pem, client.crt, and sshback_client.sh to the 
  machine with openssh-client installed
make sure 'socat' is installed
chmod +x sshback_server.sh
and then when you want to connect up, just ./sshback_server.sh
  and wait up to 1 minute it should connect back
