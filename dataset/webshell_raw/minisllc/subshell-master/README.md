SubShell is a python command shell used to control and execute commands through HTTP requests to a webshell.  SubShell acts as the interface to the remote webshells.  

SubShell has a companion project named TinyShell.  TinyShell is similar and may offer benefits over SubShell in certain situations.

TinyShell - https://github.com/minisllc/tinyshell

This project was born out of the need for a consolidated webshell framework.  There are numerous available, but I wanted to created backend framework that supports numerous web languages with a common backend.

This project uses the principle of hiding in plain sight (even over non-encrypted communications).  The goal is minimize attention.  Like numerous malicious tools, they are easy to find by defenders once they have a reason to look.  This project is designed to be stealthy, not through high-tech means, but by minimizing the triggering of a defenses such as IDS, Firewall, AV etc.

How does it do this?

  - POST requests minmize data written web logs
  - Encoded traffic helps avoid clear text detection 
  - Console interface forces a slow down when issuing commands.  Use of a webshell should be deliberate and focused.  Numerous connections may attract attention.
  - Customization of user-agent to help blend in.
  - Valid 404 errors displayed when attemped to connect to shell without 'authetnication' information

## Current Features

  - Designed for used agains Windows Based servers
  - Supports shells in asp, aspx, php, jsp
  - Logging of all actions
  - Base64 encoded command sent and receivied in POST requests
  - Invalid request generates a legitimate 404 message.
  - Tracks current directory by implementing common commands (cd, pwd, ls, dir)
  - Built in helper commands
  - Simple replay attack prevention.  Uses a token that is only valid +/- 12 hours of current time.
  - 'Authentication' using replay attack prevention

## Python Dependencies
 
 - refer to requirements.txt

## SubShell Console Reference 

Interaction with a remote 'shell' using subshell is similar to a non-interactive shell.  Non interactive commands can be submited and the results displayed.  

If an interactive command is submitted, the command will not return.  Command will display a timeout error.  This is an HTTP timeout and not an error of whether the command executed or not.

## API Used to Communicate to web shells

All command submitted to the shell are POST request with a minimum of 2 parameters (sessionid,command)

POST Parameters

|Parameter  | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|sessionid  |Used to 'authenticate' requests and minimized replay attacks.  Based on current time.  Any request +/- 12hrs will not be allowed.  If the time is off an HTTP 408 will be sent with the HTTP header expires:'timevalue'.  SubShell can use this value to adjust its authentication it sends.|            
|apikey     |used to submit OS commands|
|apikeyd    |Download file from remote host|
|apikeyu    |Upload file to remote host |
|feed       |stores Base64 encoded file.  Used for upload |

## Initial Thought and Requirements to build project
  - Single command and control server
  - Web shell payloads (3 versions)
    - .jsp, .asp, .aspx
  - Requests/Responses must be obfuscated or encrypted
    - SubShell is currently using base64
  - Web shell features
    - File browsing â€“ (track current directory)
    - File Upload/Download
    - Command execution
    - HTTP POST Requests used for C2 traffic
    - Non-POST Requests render a valid 404 response
