INTRO
=====
WeBaCoo metasploit module was created in order to provide a quick communication
channel with the compromised server, using the framework's flexible features.
Using this exploit module, you do not need to run WeBaCoo under terminal mode
to establish a remote shell with the server.

MSF PAYLOADS
============
The module's available payload list, includes those capable to run under WeBaCoo
communication model without any further customizations. Although, feel free to
customize the other's too.
In case you need a more feature-rich payload (like meterpreter) you can run
WeBaCoo under terminal mode and use the 'Upload' extension module, to upload
the generated payload to the server and interract with the framework.
