Getting the tarball

Installation
------------
Installation is easy: first unpack the tarball or zipfile into the
CGI-directory of your webserver.  This will create a subdirectory
called perlwebshell-0.1.

You should use some password protection for the directory of
PerlWebShell. Otherwise everybody out there can delete/modify your
files.
