# webshells #
Some basic webshells i wrote back in the day..  

They all have these main features :  
login / logout  
remote control  
file browser  
file editor  
file uploader / downloader  
cmd  
sql  
  
It should be quite easy to add your own modules.  
#### WARNING ####

is ILLEGAL !

None of these shells is thoroughly tested.  
Functionality may vary depending on the server configuration.
