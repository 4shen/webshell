Wordless is a junction between a WordPress plugin and a theme boilerplate that dramatically speeds up and enhances your custom theme creation. Some of its features are:

* A structured, organized and clean [theme organization](https://wordless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_pages/usage/anatomy.html)
* Bootstrap a new theme directly within wp-cli
* Write PHP templates with [Pug templating system](https://github.com/pug-php/pug)
* Write CSS stylesheets using the awesome [SCSS syntax](http://sass-lang.com)
* Out-of-the-box support to [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) configured for SCSS syntax.
* Write Javascript logic in ES2015 thanks to [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* Automatically polyfill (with [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js)) and transpile Javascript based on your support inside [`.browserslistrc`](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist)
* A growing set of handy and documented PHP helper functions ready to be used within your views
* Preconfigured support to [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) mail-catcher.
* Development workflow backed by [WebPack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) (with live reload), [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). All the standards you already know, all the customizations you may need.

## Documentation

### Complete documentation

Read the complete Wordless documentation at [wordless.readthedocs.io](https://wordless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) where you'll find - hopefully - all the informations about installation, usage guide, in depth explanation about the stack.

If you want to contribute to the documentation.

- `brew install sphinx-doc`
- `cd rtfm/`
- `sphinx-autobuild source/ build/html` and open http://127.0.0.1:8000 to watch the preview
  - the build server will autoreload your page on modifications
- update the doc; documentation about the RST syntax can be found at https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html
- `commit` and `push`; the `rtfm/` folder on master will be auto-deployed on https://wordless.readthedocs.io/

As a side note: [reStructuredText](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lextudio.restructuredtext) plugin in VSCode could be of great help linting, highlighting and previewing your texts.

### Built-in helpers documentation

You can find it at http://welaika.github.io/wordless/docs/latest/html/index.html.

If you are interested in contributing to the documentation:

- we are documenting php files in

```
 wordless/helpers/*
```

- here is a [list](http://welaika.github.io/wordless/docs/latest/html/dd/da0/todo.html) of documentation gaps :9
- `brew install doxygen`
- go and add doc following the [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) conventions
- compile the new doc with `doxygen docs/Doxyfile` (from project's root)
- you'll have an untracked folder `docs/build` in GiT. Leave it alone and `git checkout gh-pages` instead.
- `mv docs/build docs/latest` overwriting the old one
- `commit` and `push` the branch

## Development

### Deploy

* Merge your feature branch - with passing tests - in `master` with
  `git checkout master && git merge --no-ff feature` or by pull request
* On `master` update the plugin version (SEMVER) in `./wordless.php` ("Version")
  and `readme.txt` ("Stable tag") files and commit the updated files.
* do `git tag x.y.x` where *x.y.z* equals to the previously written version.
* `git push origin master --tags` to push both commits and tags
* update the changelog for the new release at https://github.com/welaika/wordless/releases

Automations will do the leftovers, including to publish updated documentation on ReadTheDocs and
the plugin on https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordless/

## Changelog

A changelog for each tag/relase is mandatory to be compiled at
https://github.com/welaika/wordless/releases.

## Known limitations

* Wordless has not been tested on Windows

## Deprecations

### 4.0

Default configuration has dropped support for CoffeeScritp and for SASS indented syntax. Obviously you are free to change Webpack's config once you've created the theme, but now we officially support ES2015 and SCSS instead.

### 3.0

Ruby-based preprocessors and the `WORDLESS_LEGACY` configuration are definitely dropped.
Theme's folder structure changed.

### 2.5

Wordless 2.5 deprecates the old ruby preprocessor support. It is disabled by default. If you need to develop an old theme you need to explicitely activate them by setting the following in your `wp-config.php`:

```php
define('WORDLESS_LEGACY', true);
```

We plan to completely remove this support in Wordless 3.

## Localization

Wordless is available in English, German, Greek, Italian and Spanish, at the moment.

The user interface was translated by Wasilis Mandratzis-Walz (German and Greek), David Mejorado (Spanish).
