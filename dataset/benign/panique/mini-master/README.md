# MINI

MINI is an extremely simple and easy to understand skeleton PHP application, reduced to the max.
MINI is NOT a professional framework and it does not come with all the stuff real frameworks have.
If you just want to show some pages, do a few database calls and a little-bit of AJAX here and there, without
reading in massive documentations of highly complex professional frameworks, then MINI might be very useful for you.
MINI is easy to install, runs nearly everywhere and doesn't make things more complicated than necessary.

For a deeper introduction into MINI have a look into this blog post:
[MINI, an extremely simple barebone PHP application](http://www.dev-metal.com/mini-extremely-simple-barebone-php-application/).

## Features

- extremely simple, easy to understand
- simple but clean structure
- makes "beautiful" clean URLs
- demo CRUD actions: Create, Read, Update and Delete database entries easily
- demo AJAX call
- tries to follow PSR 1/2 coding guidelines
- uses PDO for any database requests, comes with an additional PDO debug tool to emulate your SQL statements
- commented code
- uses only native PHP code, so people don't have to learn a framework

## Forks of MINI

### TINY
 
MINI has a smaller brother, named [TINY](https://github.com/panique/tiny). It's similar to MINI, but runs without 
mod_rewrite in nearly every environment. Not suitable for live sites, but nice for quick prototyping.
 
### MINI2 
 
MINI also has a bigger brother, named [MINI2](https://github.com/panique/mini2). It's even simpler, has been built 
using Slim and has nice features like SASS-compiling, Twig etc.

### MINI3
 
[MINI3](https://github.com/panique/mini3) it the successor of MINI, 
using the original MINI1 native application structure (without Slim 
under the hood), but with proper PSR-4 autoloading, multiple model 
classes and real namespaces.

## Requirements

- PHP 5.3.0+ (when first released), now it works fine with current stable versions PHP 5.6 and 7.0
- MySQL
- mod_rewrite activated (tutorials below, but there's also [TINY](https://github.com/panique/tiny), a mod_rewrite-less 
version of MINI)

## Installation (in Vagrant, 100% automatic)

If you are using Vagrant for your development, then you can install MINI with one click (or one command on the
command line) [[Vagrant doc](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/provisioning.html)]. MINI comes with a demo 
Vagrant-file (defines your Vagrant box) and a demo bootstrap.sh which automatically installs Apache, PHP, MySQL, 
PHPMyAdmin, git and Composer, sets a chosen password in MySQL and PHPMyadmin and even inside the application code, 
downloads the Composer-dependencies, activates mod_rewrite and edits the Apache settings, downloads the code from GitHub
and runs the demo SQL statements (for demo data). This is 100% automatic, you'll end up after +/- 5 minutes with a fully 
running installation of MINI2 inside an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Vagrant box.

To do so, put `Vagrantfile` and `bootstrap.sh` from `_vagrant` inside a folder (and nothing else). 
Do `vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64` to add Ubuntu 14.04 LTS ("Trusty Thar") 64bit to Vagrant (unless you already have 
it), then do `vagrant up` to run the box. When installation is finished you can directly use the fully installed demo 
app on `192.168.33.44`. As this just a quick demo environment the MySQL root password and the PHPMyAdmin root password 
are set to `12345678`, the project is installed in `/var/www/html/myproject`. You can change this for sure inside
`bootstrap.sh`.

## Auto-Installation on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (in 30 seconds)

You can install MINI including Apache, MySQL, PHP and PHPMyAdmin, mod_rewrite, Composer, all necessary settings and 
even the passwords inside the configs file by simply downloading one file and executing it, the entire installation 
will run 100% automatically. Find the tutorial in this blog article: 
[Install MINI in 30 seconds inside Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/install-mini-30-seconds-inside-ubuntu-14-04-lts/)

## Installation

1. Edit the database credentials in `application/config/config.php`
2. Execute the .sql statements in the `_install/`-folder (with PHPMyAdmin for example).
3. Make sure you have mod_rewrite activated on your server / in your environment. Some guidelines:
   [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/enable-mod_rewrite-ubuntu-14-04-lts/),
   [Ubuntu 12.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/enable-mod_rewrite-ubuntu-12-04-lts/),
   [EasyPHP on Windows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8158770/easyphp-and-htaccess),
   [AMPPS on Windows/Mac OS](http://www.softaculous.com/board/index.php?tid=3634&title=AMPPS_rewrite_enable/disable_option%3F_please%3F),
   [XAMPP for Windows](http://www.leonardaustin.com/blog/technical/enable-mod_rewrite-in-xampp/),
   [MAMP on Mac OS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7670561/how-to-get-htaccess-to-work-on-mamp)

MINI runs without any further configuration. You can also put it inside a sub-folder, it will work without any 
further configuration.
Maybe useful: A simple tutorial on [How to install LAMPP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, PHPMyAdmin) on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/installsetup-basic-lamp-stack-linux-apache-mysql-php-ubuntu-14-04-lts/)
and [the same for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/setup-basic-lamp-stack-linux-apache-mysql-php-ubuntu-12-04/).

## Server configs for

### nginx

```nginx
server {
    server_name default_server _;   # Listen to any servername
    listen      [::]:80;
    listen      80;

    root /var/www/html/myproject/public;

    location / {
        index index.php;
        try_files /$uri /$uri/ /index.php?url=$uri;
    }

    location ~ \.(php)$ {
        fastcgi_pass   unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index  index.php;
        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

A deeper discussion on nginx setups can be found [here](https://github.com/panique/mini/issues/55).

## Security

The script makes use of mod_rewrite and blocks all access to everything outside the /public folder.
Your .git folder/files, operating system temp files, the application-folder and everything else is not accessible
(when set up correctly). For database requests PDO is used, so no need to think about SQL injection (unless you
are using extremely outdated MySQL versions).

## Goodies

MINI comes with a little customized [PDO debugger tool](https://github.com/panique/pdo-debug) (find the code in
application/libs/helper.php), trying to emulate your PDO-SQL statements. It's extremely easy to use:

```php
$sql = "SELECT id, artist, track, link FROM song WHERE id = :song_id LIMIT 1";
$query = $this->db->prepare($sql);
$parameters = array(':song_id' => $song_id);

echo Helper::debugPDO($sql, $parameters);

$query->execute($parameters);
```

## Why has the "Error" class been renamed to "Problem"?

The project was written in PHP5 times, but with the release of PHP7 it's not possible anymore to name a class
"Error" as PHP itself has a internal Error class now. Renaming was the most simple solution, compared to other
options like "ErrorController" etc. which would add new problems like uppercase filenames etc. (which will not
work properly on some setups).

## My blog

And by the way, I'm also blogging at [Dev Metal](http://www.dev-metal.com).

## Quick-Start

#### The structure in general

The application's URL-path translates directly to the controllers (=files) and their methods inside 
application/controllers. 

`example.com/home/exampleOne` will do what the *exampleOne()* method in application/controllers/home.php says.

`example.com/home` will do what the *index()* method in application/controllers/home.php says.

`example.com` will do what the *index()* method in application/controllers/home.php says (default fallback).

`example.com/songs` will do what the *index()* method in application/controllers/songs.php says.

`example.com/songs/editsong/17` will do what the *editsong()* method in application/controllers/songs.php says and
will pass `17` as a parameter to it.

Self-explaining, right ?

#### Showing a view

Let's look at the exampleOne()-method in the home-controller (application/controllers/home.php): This simply shows
the header, footer and the example_one.php page (in views/home/). By intention as simple and native as possible.

```php
public function exampleOne()
{
    // load view
    require APP . 'views/_templates/header.php';
    require APP . 'views/home/example_one.php';
    require APP . 'views/_templates/footer.php';
}
```  

#### Working with data

Let's look into the index()-method in the songs-controller (application/controllers/songs.php): Similar to exampleOne,
but here we also request data. Again, everything is extremely reduced and simple: $this->model->getAllSongs() simply
calls the getAllSongs()-method in application/model/model.php.

```php
public function index()
{
    // getting all songs and amount of songs
    $songs = $this->model->getAllSongs();
    $amount_of_songs = $this->model->getAmountOfSongs();

   // load view. within the view files we can echo out $songs and $amount_of_songs easily
    require APP . 'views/_templates/header.php';
    require APP . 'views/songs/index.php';
    require APP . 'views/_templates/footer.php';
}
```

For extreme simplicity, all data-handling methods are in application/model/model.php. This is for sure not really
professional, but the most simple implementation. Have a look how getAllSongs() in model.php looks like: Pure and
super-simple PDO.

```php
public function getAllSongs()
{
    $sql = "SELECT id, artist, track, link FROM song";
    $query = $this->db->prepare($sql);
    $query->execute();
    
    return $query->fetchAll();
}
```

The result, here $songs, can then easily be used directly
inside the view files (in this case application/views/songs/index.php, in a simplified example):

```php
<tbody>
<?php foreach ($songs as $song) { ?>
    <tr>
        <td><?php if (isset($song->artist)) echo htmlspecialchars($song->artist, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'); ?></td>
        <td><?php if (isset($song->track)) echo htmlspecialchars($song->track, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'); ?></td>
    </tr>
<?php } ?>
</tbody>
```

## History

MINI is the successor of php-mvc. As php-mvc didn't provide a real MVC structure (and several people complained
about that - which is totally right!) I've renamed and rebuild the project.

## Dear haters, trolls and everything-sucks-people...

... MINI is just a simple helper-tool I've created for my daily work, simply because it was much easier to setup and to
handle than real frameworks. For daily agency work, quick prototyping and frontend-driven projects it's totally okay,
does the job and there's absolutely no reason to discuss why it's "shit compared to Laravel", why it does not follow 
several MVC principles or why there's no personal unpaid support or no russian translation or similar weird stuff. 
The trolling against Open-Source-projects (and their authors) has really reached insane dimensions.

I've written this unpaid, voluntarily, in my free-time and uploaded it on GitHub to share.
It's totally free, for private and commercial use. If you don't like it, don't use it.
If you see issues, then please write a ticket (and if you are really cool: I'm very thankful for any commits!).
But don't bash, don't complain, don't hate. Only bad people do so.
