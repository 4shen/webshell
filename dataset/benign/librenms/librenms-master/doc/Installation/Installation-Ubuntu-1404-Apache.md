# On the DB Server

This host is where the MySQL database runs.  It could be the same
machine as your network management server (this is the most common
initial deployment scenario).

> ** Whilst we are working on ensuring LibreNMS is compatible with
> MySQL strict mode, for now, please disable this after mysql is

You are free to choose between using MySQL or MariaDB:

## MySQL

```bash
apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client
mysql -uroot -p
```

## MariaDB

```bash
apt-get install mariadb-server mariadb-client
mysql -uroot -p
```

## General

Input the MySQL root password to enter the MySQL command-line interface.

Create the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE librenms CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'librenms'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON librenms.* TO 'librenms'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit
```

Replace `<ip>` above with the IP or DNS name of the server running
LibreNMS.  If your database is on the same server as LibreNMS, you can
use `localhost`.

If you are deploying a separate database server, you need to change
the `bind-address`.  If your MySQL database resides on the same server
as LibreNMS, you should skip this step.

```bash
vim /etc/mysql/my.cnf
```

Within the [mysqld] section please add:

```mysql
innodb_file_per_table=1
```

Find the line: `bind-address = 127.0.0.1`

Change `127.0.0.1` to the IP address that your MySQL server should
listen on.  Restart MySQL:

If you see a line that starts `sql-mode` then change this to `sql-mode=""`.

```bash
service mysql restart
```

# On the NMS

This host is where the web server and SNMP poller run.  It could be
the same machine as your database server.

Install the required software:

```bash
apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 php5-cli php5-mysql php5-gd php5-snmp php-pear php5-curl snmp graphviz php5-mcrypt php5-json apache2 fping imagemagick whois mtr-tiny nmap python-mysqldb snmpd php-net-ipv4 php-net-ipv6 rrdtool git
```

The packages listed above are an all-inclusive list of packages that
were necessary on a clean install of Ubuntu 12.04/14.04.

You need to configure snmpd appropriately if you have not already done
so.  An absolute minimal config for snmpd is:

```
rocommunity public 127.0.0.1
```

Adding the above line to `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf` and running `service
snmpd restart` will activate this config.

In `/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini` and `/etc/php5/cli/php.ini`, ensure
 date.timezone is set to your preferred time zone.  See
<http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php> for a list of
supported timezones.  Valid examples are: "America/New York",
 "Australia/Brisbane", "Etc/UTC".

Please also ensure that `allow_url_fopen` is enabled. Other functions
needed for LibreNMS include
`exec,passthru,shell_exec,escapeshellarg,escapeshellcmd,proc_close,proc_open,popen`.

# Adding the librenms-user

```bash
useradd librenms -d /opt/librenms -M -r
usermod -a -G librenms www-data
```

# Cloning

LibreNMS is installed using git.  If you're not familiar with git,
check out the [git book][2] or the tips at [git ready][3].  The
initial install from github.com is called a `git clone`; subsequent
updates are done through `git pull`.

You can clone the repository via HTTPS or SSH.  In either case, you
need to ensure that the appropriate port (443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH)
is open in the outbound direction for your server.

```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/librenms/librenms.git librenms
cd /opt/librenms
```

The recommended method of cloning a git repository is HTTPS.  If you
would like to clone via SSH instead, use the command `git clone
git@github.com:librenms/librenms.git librenms` instead.

Sometimes the initial clone can take quite a while (nearly 3 minutes
on a 10 Mbps fibre connection in Australia is a recent example).  If
it's a big problem to you, you can save about 50% of the bandwidth by
not pulling down the full git history.  This comes with some
limitations (namely that you can't use it as the basis for further git
repos), but if you're not planning to develop for LibreNMS it's an
acceptable option.  To perform the initial clone without full history,
run the following instead:

```bash
cd /opt
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/librenms/librenms.git librenms
cd /opt/librenms
```

# Web Interface

To prepare the web interface (and adding devices shortly), you'll need
to create and chown a directory as well as create an Apache vhost.

First, create and chown the `rrd` directory and create the `logs` directory:

```bash
mkdir rrd logs
chown -R librenms:librenms /opt/librenms
chmod 775 rrd
```

> NOTE: If you're not running Ubuntu or Debian, you will need to
> change `www-data` to the user and group which run the Apache web
> server.
> If you're planing on running rrdcached, make sure that the path is
> also chmod'ed to 775 and chown'ed to librenms:librenms.

Next, add the following to `/etc/apache2/sites-available/librenms.conf`:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot /opt/librenms/html/
  ServerName  librenms.example.com
  CustomLog /opt/librenms/logs/access_log combined
  ErrorLog /opt/librenms/logs/error_log
  AllowEncodedSlashes On
  <Directory "/opt/librenms/html/">
    AllowOverride All
    Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

If you are running Apache 2.2.18 or higher then change
`AllowEncodedSlashes On` to `AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode`

If you have Apache 2.3 or newer then please add the following line
before `AllowOverride All`:

```apache
Require all granted
```

On at least Ubuntu 14.04 (and possibly other distributions and
versions as well), mcrypt is not enabled on install.  Run the
following to enable it:

```bash
php5enmod mcrypt
```

Change `librenms.example.com` to the appropriate hostname for your
domain, then enable the vhost and restart Apache:

```bash
a2ensite librenms.conf
a2enmod rewrite
service apache2 restart
```

If this is the only site you are hosting on this server (it should be
:)) then you will need to disable the default site setup in Ubuntu:

```bash
a2dissite 000-default
```

(To get to your LibreNMS install externally, you'll also need add it
to your DNS or hosts file.)

# Manual vs. web installer

At this stage you can either launch the web installer by going to
<http://librenms.example.com/install.php>, follow the onscreen
instructions then skip to the 'Add localhost' section. Alternatively
if you want to continue the setup manually then just keep following
these instructions.

```bash
cp config.php.default config.php
vim config.php
```

Change the values to the right of the equal sign for lines beginning
with `$config[db_]` to match your database information as setup above.

Change the value of `$config['snmp']['community']` from `public` to
whatever your read-only SNMP community is.  If you have multiple
communities, set it to the most common.

** Be sure you have no characters (including whitespace like:
newlines, spaces, tabs, etc) outside of the `<?php?>` blocks. Your
graphs will break otherwise. **

# Initialise the database

Initiate the follow database with the following command:

```bash
php build-base.php
```

# Create admin user

Create the admin user - priv should be 10

```bash
php adduser.php <name> <pass> 10 <email>
```

Substitute your desired username, password and email address--and
leave the angled brackets off.

# Validate your install

Run validate.php as root in the librenms directory

```bash
php validate.php
```

This will check your install to verify it is set up correctly.

# Add localhost

```bash
php addhost.php localhost public v2c
```

This assumes you haven't made community changes--if you have, replace
`public` with your community.  It also assumes SNMP v2c.  If you're
using v3, there are additional steps (NOTE: instructions for SNMPv3 to
come).

Discover localhost::

```bash
php discovery.php -h all
```

# Create cronjob

LibreNMS uses Job Snijders' [poller-wrapper.py][1].  By default, the
cron job runs `poller-wrapper.py` with 16 threads.  The current
recommendation is to use 4 threads per core as a rule of thumb.  If
the thread count needs to be changed, you can do so by editing the
cron file (`/etc/cron.d/librenms`).  Just add a number after
`poller-wrapper.py`, as in the example below:

```bash
/opt/librenms/poller-wrapper.py 12 >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

Create the cronjob

```bash
cp librenms.nonroot.cron /etc/cron.d/librenms
```

> NOTE: Keep in mind  that cron, by default, only uses a very limited
> set of environment variables. You may need to configure proxy
> variables for the cron invocation. Alternatively adding the proxy
> settings in config.php is possible too. The config.php file will be
> created in the upcoming steps. Review the following URL after you
> finished librenms install steps:
> <https://docs.librenms.org/Support/Configuration/#proxy-support>

# Copy logrotate config

LibreNMS keeps logs in `/opt/librenms/logs`. Over time these can
become large and be rotated out.  To rotate out the old logs you can
use the provided logrotate config file:

```bash
cp misc/librenms.logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/librenms
```

# Daily Updates

LibreNMS performs daily updates by default.  At 00:15 system time
every day, a `git pull --no-edit --quiet` is performed.  You can
override this default by editing your `config.php` file.  Remove the
comment (the `#` mark) on the line:

```php
#$config['update'] = 0;
```

so that it looks like this:

```php
$config['update'] = 0;
```

Install complete

Please allow for 2-3 runs of the poller-wrapper for data to start
appearing in the WebUI. If you don't see data after this, please refer
to the [FAQ](http://docs.librenms.org/Support/FAQ/) for assistance.

That's it!  You now should be able to log in to
<http://librenms.example.com/>. Please note that we have not covered
HTTPS setup in this example, so your LibreNMS install is not secure by
default.  Please do not expose it to the public Internet unless you
have configured HTTPS and taken appropriate web server hardening
steps.

It would be great if you would consider opting into the stats system
we have, please see [this
page](http://docs.librenms.org/General/Callback-Stats-and-Privacy/) on
what it is and how to enable it.
