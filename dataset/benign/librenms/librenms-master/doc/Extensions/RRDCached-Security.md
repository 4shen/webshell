# Securing with nginx

path: blob/master/doc/

According to the [man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rrdcached),
under "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS", rrdcached has no authentication or
security except for running under a unix socket. If you choose to use
a network socket instead of a unix socket, you will need to secure
your rrdcached installation. To do so you can proxy rrdcached using
nginx to allow only specific IPs to connect.

Using the same setup above, using nginx version 1.9.0 or later, you
can follow this setup to proxy the default rrdcached port to the local
unix socket.

(You can use `./conf.d` for your configuration as well)

`mkdir /etc/nginx/streams-{available,enabled}`

add the following to your nginx.conf file:

```nginx
#/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
...
stream {
    include /etc/nginx/streams-enabled/*;
}
```

Add this to `/etc/nginx/streams-available/rrd`

```nginx
server {
    listen 42217;

    error_log  /var/log/nginx/rrd.stream.error.log;

    allow $LibreNMS_IP;
    deny all;

    proxy_pass unix:/var/run/rrdcached/rrdcached.sock;
}

```

Replace `$LibreNMS_IP` with the ip of the server that will be using
rrdcached. You can specify more than one `allow` statement. This will
bind nginx to TCP 42217 (the default rrdcached port), allow the
specified IPs to connect, and deny all others.

next, we'll symlink the config to streams-enabled:
`ln -s /etc/nginx/streams-{available,enabled}/rrd`

and reload nginx
`service nginx reload`
