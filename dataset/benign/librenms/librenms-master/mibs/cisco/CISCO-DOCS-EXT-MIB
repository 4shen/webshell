        REVISION        "200110070000Z"
        DESCRIPTION            "This is the MIB module for the Cisco specific extension 
             objects of Data Over Cable Service, Radio Frequency 
             interface.  There is a standard MIB for Data-Over-Cable 
             Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) and in Cisco,
             it is called DOCS-IF-MIB. Besides the objects in 
             DOCS-IF-MIB, this MIB module contains the extension 
             objects to manage the Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS).

             This MIB module includes objects for the scheduler 
             that supports Quality of Service (QoS) of MCNS/DOCSIS 
             compliant Radio Frequency (RF) interfaces in Cable Modem 
             Termination Systems (CMTS). And the purpose is to let 
             users configure attributes of the schedulers in 
             order to ensure the Quality of Service and fairness for 
             modem requests according to users' business needs. 
             Also this MIB shows various states of the schedulers 
             for users to monitor of the schedulers' current status. 
            
             This MIB module also includes connection status objects
             for cable modems and Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) 
             and the purpose is to let users easily get the connection 
             status and manage access group information about cable 
             modems and CPE.

             This MIB module also includes objects for upstream 
             configuration for automated spectrum management in 
             order to mitigate upstream impairment.

             This MIB module also includes objects to keep count of
             the total # of modems,# of registered and # of active 
             modems on the mac interface as well as each 
             upstream. "

        REVISION        "200110070000Z"
        DESCRIPTION            "Added new objects cdxIfCmtsCmStatusOnlineTimesNum and
