## Contribution Guidelines

* This repository is for conference or meetup talks which are really useful to the PHP developers in general.
* Ideally they are not tutorials, recorded screencasts or podcasts (except a couple of existing videos).
* Framework specific talks and tutorials are best avoided.
* Avoid duplications - make sure they are not already listed or not discussed in pull requests/issues.
* Repository owner can delete or re-order talks to improve the quality of repository.
* I would also love to hear why you think the video is a must watch.

Thank you for your suggestions!
