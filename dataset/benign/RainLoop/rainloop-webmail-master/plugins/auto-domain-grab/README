What is it?

In essense, this plugin allows for multiple users across multiple servers to use one RainLoop installation,
all without the administrator needing to create each domain separately. This plugin detects the required
hostname from the inputted email address (for example, it would detect "example.com" as the hostname if
"info@example.com" is inputted). This hostname is then used for IMAP and SMTP communication.

How to Use:

1) Activate plugin
2) Visit Settings, and add a new wildcard domain "*"
3) Set your ports/ssl requirements as needed. These will not be changed by the plugin.
4) In the SMTP and/or IMAP host fields, place the single word "auto". This will be replaced when the plugin is active.
5) That's it! The plugin should now work!
