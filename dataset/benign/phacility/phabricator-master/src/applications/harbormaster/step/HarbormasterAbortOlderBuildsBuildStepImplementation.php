When run against a revision, this build step will abort any older copies of
the same build plan which are currently running against older diffs.

There are some nuances to the behavior:

  - if this build step is triggered manually, it won't abort anything;
  - this build step won't abort manual builds;
  - this build step won't abort anything if the diff it is building isn't
    the active diff when it runs.

Build results on outdated diffs often aren't very important, so this may
reduce build queue load without any substantial cost.
