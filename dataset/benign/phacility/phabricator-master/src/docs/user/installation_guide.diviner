@group intro

This document contains basic install instructions to get Phabricator up and
running.

Overview
========

Phabricator is a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) application. To install
Phabricator, you will need:

  - a normal computer to install it on (shared hosts and unusual environments
    are not supported) running some flavor of Linux or a similar OS;
  - a domain name (like `phabricator.mycompany.com`);
  - basic sysadmin skills;
  - Apache, nginx, or another webserver;
  - PHP, MySQL, and Git.

The remainder of this document details these requirements.

Installation Requirements
=========================

You will need **a computer**. Options include:

  - **A Normal Computer**: This is strongly recommended. Many installs use a VM
    in EC2. Phabricator installs properly and works well on a normal computer.
  - **A Shared Host**: This may work, but is not recommended. Many shared
    hosting environments have restrictions which prevent some of Phabricator's
    features from working. Consider using a normal computer instead. We do not
    support shared hosts.
  - **A SAN Appliance, Network Router, Gaming Console, Raspberry Pi, etc.**:
    Although you may be able to install Phabricator on specialized hardware, it
    is unlikely to work well and will be difficult for us to support. Strongly
    consider using a normal computer instead. We do not support specialized
    hardware.
  - **A Toaster, Car, Firearm, Thermostat, etc.**: Yes, many modern devices now
    have embedded computing capability. We live in interesting times. However,
    you should not install Phabricator on these devices. Instead, install it on
    a normal computer. We do not support installing on noncomputing devices.

To install the Phabricator server software, you will need an **operating
system** on your normal computer which is **not Windows**. Note that the
command line interface //does// work on Windows, and you can //use//
Phabricator from any operating system with a web browser. However, the server
software does not run on Windows. It does run on most other operating systems,
so choose one of these instead:

  - **Linux**: Most installs use Linux.
  - **Mac OS X**: Mac OS X is an acceptable flavor of Linux.
  - **FreeBSD**: While FreeBSD is certainly not a flavor of Linux, it is a fine
    operating system possessed of many desirable qualities, and Phabricator will
    install and run properly on FreeBSD.
  - **Solaris, etc.**: Other systems which look like Linux and quack like Linux
    will generally work fine, although we may suffer a reduced ability to
    support and resolve issues on unusual operating systems.

Beyond an operating system, you will need **a webserver**.

  - **Apache**: Many installs use Apache + `mod_php`.
  - **nginx**: Many installs use nginx + `php-fpm`.
  - **lighttpd**: `lighttpd` is less popular than Apache or nginx, but it
    works fine.
  - **Other**: Other webservers which can run PHP are also likely to work fine,
    although these installation instructions will not cover how to set them up.
  - **PHP Builtin Server**: You can use the builtin PHP webserver for
    development or testing, although it should not be used in production.

You will also need:

  - **MySQL**: You need MySQL. We strongly recommend MySQL 5.5 or newer.
  - **PHP**: You need PHP 5.2 or newer.

You'll probably also need a **domain name**. In particular, you should read this
note:

NOTE: Phabricator must be installed on an entire domain. You can not install it
to a path on an existing domain, like `example.com/phabricator/`. Instead,
install it to an entire domain or subdomain, like `phabricator.example.com`.

Level Requirements
==================

To install and administrate Phabricator, you'll need to be comfortable with
common system administration skills. For example, you should be familiar with
using the command line, installing software on your operating system of choice,
working with the filesystem, managing processes, dealing with permissions,
editing configuration files, and setting environment variables.

If you aren't comfortable with these skills, you can still try to perform an
install. The install documentation will attempt to guide you through what you
need to know. However, if you aren't very familiar or comfortable with using
this set of skills to troubleshoot and resolve problems, you may encounter
issues which you have substantial difficulty working through.

We assume users installing and administrating Phabricator are comfortable with
common system administration skills and concepts. If you aren't, proceed at
your own risk and expect that your skills may be tested.

Installing Required Components
==============================

If you are installing on Ubuntu or an RedHat derivative, there are install
scripts available which should handle most of the things discussed in this
document for you:

  - **RedHat Derivatives**:
    [[ https://secure.phabricator.com/diffusion/P/browse/master/scripts/install/install_rhel-derivs.sh
     | install_rhel-derivs.sh ]]
  - **Ubuntu**:
    [[ https://secure.phabricator.com/diffusion/P/browse/master/scripts/install/install_ubuntu.sh
     | install_ubuntu.sh ]]

If those work for you, you can skip directly to the
@{article:Configuration Guide}. These scripts are also available in the
`scripts/install` directory in the project itself.

Otherwise, here's a general description of what you need to install:

  - git (usually called "git" in package management systems)
  - Apache (usually "httpd" or "apache2") (or nginx)
  - MySQL Server (usually "mysqld" or "mysql-server")
  - PHP (usually "php")
  - Required PHP extensions: mbstring, iconv, mysql (or mysqli), curl, pcntl
    (these might be something like "php-mysql" or "php5-mysqlnd")
  - Optional PHP extensions: gd, apc (special instructions for APC are available
    below if you have difficulty installing it), xhprof (instructions below,
    you only need this if you are developing Phabricator)

If you already have LAMP setup, you've probably already got everything you need.
It may also be helpful to refer to the install scripts above, even if they don't
work for your system.

Now that you have all that stuff installed, grab Phabricator and its
dependencies:

  $ cd somewhere/ # pick some install directory
  somewhere/ $ git clone https://github.com/phacility/libphutil.git
  somewhere/ $ git clone https://github.com/phacility/arcanist.git
  somewhere/ $ git clone https://github.com/phacility/phabricator.git

= Installing APC (Optional) =

Like everything else written in PHP, Phabricator will run much faster with APC
installed. You likely need to install "pcre-devel" first:

  sudo yum install pcre-devel

Then you have two options. Either install via PECL (try this first):

  sudo yum install php-pear
  sudo pecl install apc

**If that doesn't work**, grab the package from PECL directly and follow the
build instructions there:

http://pecl.php.net/package/APC

Installing APC is optional but **strongly recommended**, especially on
production hosts.

Once APC is installed, test that it is available by running:

  php -i | grep apc

If it doesn't show up, add:

  extension=apc.so

..to "/etc/php.d/apc.ini" or the "php.ini" file indicated by "php -i".

= Next Steps =

Continue by:

  - configuring Phabricator with the @{article:Configuration Guide}; or
  - learning how to keep Phabricator up to date with
    @{article:Upgrading Phabricator}.
