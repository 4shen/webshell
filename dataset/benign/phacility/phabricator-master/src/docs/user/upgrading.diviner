@title Upgrading Phabricator
@group intro

This document contains instructions for keeping Phabricator up to date.

Overview
========

Phabricator is under active development, and new features are released
continuously. Staying up to date will keep your install secure.

We recommend installs upgrade regularly (every 1-2 weeks). Upgrades usually go
smoothly and complete in a few minutes. If you put off upgrades for a long
time, it may take a lot more work to bring things up to date if you want access
to a useful new feature or an important security change.


Staying On Top of Changes
=========================

We release a weekly [[https://secure.phabricator.com/w/changelog | Changelog]],
which describes changes in the previous week. You can look at the changelogs
for an idea of what new features are available, upcoming changes, security
information, and warnings about compatibility issues or migrations.


Stable Branch
=============

You can either run the `master` or `stable` branch of Phabricator. The `stable`
branch is run in the [[ https://phacility.com | Phacility Cluster ]], and lags
about a week behind `master`.

The `stable` branch is a little more stable than `master`, and may be helpful
if you administrate a larger install.

We promote `master` to `stable` about once a week, then publish the changelog
and deploy the cluster. During the week, major bugfixes are cherry-picked to
the `stable` branch. The changelog lists the `stable` hashes for that week,
as well as any fixes which were cherry-picked.

To switch to `stable`, check the branch out in each working copy:

  phabricator/ $ git checkout stable
  arcanist/ $ git checkout stable
  libphutil/ $ git checkout stable

You can now follow the upgrade process normally.


Upgrade Process
===============

IMPORTANT: You **MUST** restart Phabricator after upgrading. For help, see
@{article:Restarting Phabricator}.

IMPORTANT: You **MUST** upgrade `libphutil`, `arcanist` and `phabricator` at
the same time.

Phabricator runs on many different systems, with many different webservers.
Given this diversity, we don't currently maintain a comprehensive upgrade
script which can work on any system. However, the general steps are the same
on every system:

  - Stop the webserver (including `php-fpm`, if you use it).
  - Stop the daemons, with `phabricator/bin/phd stop`.
  - Run `git pull` in `libphutil/`, `arcanist/` and `phabricator/`.
  - Run `phabricator/bin/storage upgrade`.
  - Start the daemons, with `phabricator/bin/phd start`.
  - Restart the webserver (and `php-fpm`, if you stopped it earlier).

For some more discussion details, see @{article:Configuration Guide}.

This template script roughly outlines the steps required to upgrade Phabricator.
You'll need to adjust paths and commands a bit for your particular system:

```lang=sh
#!/bin/sh

set -e
set -x

# This is an example script for updating Phabricator, similar to the one used to
# update <https://secure.phabricator.com/>. It might not work perfectly on your
# system, but hopefully it should be easy to adapt. This script is not intended
# to work without modifications.

# NOTE: This script assumes you are running it from a directory which contains
# arcanist/, libphutil/, and phabricator/.

ROOT=`pwd` # You can hard-code the path here instead.

### STOP WEB SERVER AND DAEMONS ###############################################

# Stop daemons.
$ROOT/phabricator/bin/phd stop

# If running the notification server, stop it.
# $ROOT/phabricator/bin/aphlict stop

# Stop the webserver (apache, nginx, lighttpd, etc). This command will differ
# depending on which system and webserver you are running: replace it with an
# appropriate command for your system.
# NOTE: If you're running php-fpm, you should stop it here too.

sudo /etc/init.d/httpd stop

### UPDATE WORKING COPIES ######################################################

cd $ROOT/libphutil
git pull

cd $ROOT/arcanist
git pull

cd $ROOT/phabricator
git pull

# Upgrade the database schema. You may want to add the "--force" flag to allow
# this script to run noninteractively.
$ROOT/phabricator/bin/storage upgrade

# Restart the webserver. As above, this depends on your system and webserver.
# NOTE: If you're running php-fpm, restart it here too.
sudo /etc/init.d/httpd start

# Restart daemons.
$ROOT/phabricator/bin/phd start

# If running the notification server, start it.
# $ROOT/phabricator/bin/aphlict start
```
