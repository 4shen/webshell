Silex, a simple Web Framework
=============================

**WARNING**: Silex is in maintenance mode only. Ends of life is set to June
2018. Read more on `Symfony's blog <https://symfony.com/blog/the-end-of-silex>`_.

Silex is a PHP micro-framework to develop websites based on `Symfony
components`_:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

    $app = new Silex\Application();

    $app->get('/hello/{name}', function ($name) use ($app) {
      return 'Hello '.$app->escape($name);
    });

    $app->run();

Silex works with PHP 7.1.3 or later.

Installation
------------

The recommended way to install Silex is through `Composer`_:

.. code-block:: bash

Alternatively, you can download the `silex.zip`_ file and extract it.
