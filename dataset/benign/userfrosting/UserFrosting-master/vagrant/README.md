## Using Vagrant with UserFrosting

UserFrosting includes support for Vagrant. This allows you to run UserFrosting without the need to set up your own local web server with traditional WAMP/MAMP stacks. It also provides a consistent environment between developers for writing and debugging code changes more productively.

UserFrosting uses the [Laravel/Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/homestead) Vagrant box. It runs a Linux server with Ubuntu 16.04, PHP 7.1, Nginx, SQLite3, MySQL, and a whole lot more (complete specs below).

## Get Started

* Download and Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
* Download and Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

* Clone Homestead from the root of your cloned fork of the UserFrosting Git repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/laravel/homestead.git vagrant/Homestead
```

* Run `vagrant up` from the root of your cloned fork of the UserFrosting Git repository

```sh
$ vagrant up
```

* Access UserFrosting at `http://192.168.10.10/`
* Username: **admin**
* Password: **adminadmin12**

## Additional commands:
* Access your Linux server from the command line:

```sh
$ vagrant ssh
```

* Pause your server:

```sh
$ vagrant suspend
```

* Shut down your server:

```sh
$ vagrant halt
```

* Delete and remove your server:

```sh
$ vagrant destroy
```

> Note: destroying the vagrant server will remove all traces of the VM from your computer, reclaiming any disk space used by it. However, it also means the next time you vagrant up, you will be creating a brand new VM with a fresh install of UserFrosting and a new database.

## Customizing the UserFrosting configuration

By default, UserFrosting is pre-configured to install with a MySQL database. You can, however, switch to PostegreSQL or SQLite3 by editing the `install-config.yml` file in the vagrant directory. The next time you run `vagrant up` (or `vagrant provision`) it will be installed under the new configuration.

If you prefer to access UserFrosting from the more friendly URL `http://userfrosting.test` then you must update your computer's hosts file. This file is typically located at `/etc/hosts` for Mac/Linux or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` for Windows. Open this file and add the following line to it, at the very bottom, and save.

```
192.168.10.10  userfrosting.test
```

## How it all works

When you vagrant up, the Laravel/Homestead box is transparently loaded as a Virtual Machine on your computer (this may take several minutes the very first time while it downloads the VM image to your computer). Your local UserFrosting repository clone is mirrored/shared with the VM, so you can work on the UserFrosting code on your computer, and see the changes immediately when you browse to UserFrosting at the URL provided by the VM.

This is very similar to traditional methods of working with a local WAMP/MAMP stack, except the webserver is now being provided by a VM of a Linux server. The advantages here are the exact same Linux server environment is being used by everybody who uses Vagrant with UserFrosting, so there will be consist behaviour unlike when everybody is developing on different versions of PHP, server configurations, etc.

The environment is also "sandboxed" from your system. This means you don't need to worry about adjusting your own computer's internal PHP settings, setting up databases, or doing damage to your system or to UserFrosting. Other than the UserFrosting codebase, which lives on your computer, all execution is taking place within the VM and you can at any time, halt or destroy the VM and start a brand new one.

There are some caveats, however. You can only run one vagrant VM for the UserFrosting repository. And of course, the database will be destroyed when you vagrant destroy. If the database is important, you should SSH into your vagrant VM and export/import the DB as needed using SSH commands.

For example, to export/import a MySQL database (using UserFrosting's `store` directory):

SSH into the VM

```sh
$ vagrant ssh
```

Export MySQL:

```sh
$ mysqldump -uhomestead -psecret UserFrosting > /home/vagrant/userfrosting/userfrosting.sql
```

Import MySQL:

```sh
$ mysql -uhomestead -psecret UserFrosting < /home/vagrant/userfrosting/userfrosting.sql
```
