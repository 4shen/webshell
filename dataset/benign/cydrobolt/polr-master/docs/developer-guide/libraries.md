## Polr Libraries
-----------------------

To interact with Polr's API, you may opt to use a library or write your own integration.
As not all languages and frameworks are currently supported by a library, it is encouraged
that you take a look at the [API documentation](api/) to integrate Polr into your application.

## Unofficial libraries
### Python
- [mypolr](https://github.com/fauskanger/mypolr) is a Python 3 package for interacting with the Polr 2.0 API. ([Documentation](https://mypolr.readthedocs.io))
