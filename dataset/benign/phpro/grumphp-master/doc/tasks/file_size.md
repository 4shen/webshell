# File size

The file size task ensures a maximum size for a file to be added to git.

```yaml
# grumphp.yml
grumphp:
    tasks:
        file_size:
            max_size: 10M
            ignore_patterns: []
```

**max_size**

*Default: 10M*

Defines the maximum size. The target value may use magnitudes of kilobytes (k, ki),
megabytes (m, mi), or gigabytes (g, gi). Those suffixed with an i use the appropriate 2**n version
in accordance with the IEC standard.


**ignore_patterns**

*Default: []*

This is a list of patterns that will be ignored. With this option you can skip files.
Leave this option blank to run analysis for all files.
