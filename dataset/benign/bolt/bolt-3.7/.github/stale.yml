  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
  recent activity. Maybe this issue has been fixed in a recent release, or
  perhaps it is not affecting a lot of people?

  It will be closed if no further activity occurs, because we like to keep the
  issue queue concise and actual.

  If you think this issue is still relevant, please let us know. Especially if
  youâ€™d like to help resolve the issue, either by helping us pinpointing the 
  cause of a bug, or in implementing a fix or new feature.
