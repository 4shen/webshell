name:  ðŸ“® Feature Request / RFC
about: Open a feature request, if you want to discuss a new feature.
---

A brief description of your feature request goes here.

<!--
If you open a "request for comment" (or "RFC" for short) please prefix your
title with [RFC]. It is expected that you are willing to help out in the
implementation of said feature request. Other appropiate labels will be applied
by the Bolt team, when assessing issues.

How can you help?
-------------------------------

<!--
The resources (read: available time and effort) of Bolt's core team is limited.
If we're going to consider your request, please describe how you are willing
to help out, to see the new feature become a reality.

If we can not work on your suggestion, please don't take it personally. Most
likely, it's either:

 - We think your idea is valid, but we can't find the time to work on it.
 - Your idea might be better suited as an extension, if it's not suitable for
   the majority of users.
