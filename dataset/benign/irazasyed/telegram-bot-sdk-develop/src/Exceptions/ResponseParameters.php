 * @property int $migrateToChatId (Optional). The group has been migrated to a supergroup with the specified identifier.
 *           This number may be greater than 32 bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects
 *           in interpreting it. But it is smaller than 52 bits, so a signed 64 bit integer or double-precision float
 *           type are safe for storing this identifier.
 * @property int $retryAfter      (Optional). In case of exceeding flood control, the number of seconds left to wait
 *           before the request can be repeated
 *
 * @TODO Integrate with exceptions / error handler.
