  Place your custom style overrides here.
  Checkout /src/assets/global.scss for an overview of all globally available css variables you

  NOTE: The main application's styling is included through JavaScript. Therefore, it gets added to
    the head _after_ this file. If you want to override the globally used CSS variables, you can either
    use !important, or increase the specificity from :root
