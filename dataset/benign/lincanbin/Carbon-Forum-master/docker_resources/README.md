You can docker pull images from the docker image run this command 
```docker
docker pull lincanbin/carbon-forum:latest
```
You can also use Dockerfile build your own carbon_forum docker images like this:
```docker
docker build   -t lincanbin/carbon-forum:latest
```
And then run a new docker container:
```docker
docker run -it -d -p  1314:80 --name carbon_forum lincanbin/carbon-forum:latest
```
If there is not any problem,you can access the carbon forum from http://docker_host:1314/install/ , the docker_host is your docker engine's host name or ip address.

make fun!
