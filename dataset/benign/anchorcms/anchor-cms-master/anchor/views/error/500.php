    - Unfortunately, Microsoft has added a clever new
    - "feature" to Internet Explorer. If the text of
    - an error's message is "too small", specifically
    - less than 512 bytes, Internet Explorer returns
    - its own error message. You can turn that off,
    - but it's pretty tricky to find switch called
    - "smart error messages". That means, of course,
    - that short error messages are censored by default.
    - IIS always returns error messages that are long
    - enough to make Internet Explorer happy. The
    - workaround is pretty simple: pad the error
    - message with a big comment like this to push it
    - over the five hundred and twelve bytes minimum.
    - Of course, that's exactly what you're reading
    - right now.
