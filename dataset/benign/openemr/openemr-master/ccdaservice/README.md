# About
This module/service will provide the necessary template engine to create a Patient Summary CCD.
CCD's can be generated from the Onsite Patient Portal or the Carecoordination Module.
## Prepare
* If not already completed, you must install/initialize the CCM features by going to the Modules->Manage Modules top menu then click Unregistered tab and install the necessary components.
* Add any appropriate settings like granting Access Control for the appropriate users. Menu item: Modules->Manage Modules->Access Control->General->Care Coordination.
* Ignore any errors that do not throw you back to command prompt when using npm install as some libs need to be compiled and is verbose about it.

Whenever there are new versions or updates, be sure to navigate into the ccdaservice directory and run:
- npm i --production

This will ensure the lastest libraries are installed.

### Use
* CCDA service must be enabled in OpenEMR's menu Globals->Connectors.
* This service will automatically start on demand when required by OpenEMR.
### Developing
* Note that these scripts run in strict mode so javascript will hold you very much accountable with how objects and variables are handled.
* For now, node modules are run local to service directory so all support dependecies are installed there.
### Tools
* The nodejs ccda service now starts on demand.
