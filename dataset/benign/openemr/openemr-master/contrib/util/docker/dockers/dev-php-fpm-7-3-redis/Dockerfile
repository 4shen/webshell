# php-fpm Dockerfile build for openemr development docker environment

RUN apt-get update

# Add mariadb-client package that is needed in the OpenEMR Backup gui, which does direct command mysql commands
# Add imagemagick that is needed for some image processing in OpenEMR
# Note this basically add 160MB of space to the docker, so would be nice for OpenEMR to not require this stuff
#  and instead rely on php scripts, if possible.
