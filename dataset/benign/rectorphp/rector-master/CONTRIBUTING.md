# How to Contribute

Just follow 3 rules:

- **1 feature per pull-request**
- **New features need tests**
- Tests, coding standards and PHPStan **checks must pass**:

    ```bash
    composer complete-check
    ```

    Do you need to fix coding standards? Run:

    ```bash
    composer fix-cs
    ```

We would be happy to accept PRs that follow these guidelines.
