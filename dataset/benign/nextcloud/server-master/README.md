There are many ways to contribute, of which development is only one! Find out [how to get involved](https://nextcloud.com/contribute/), including as translator, designer, tester, helping others and much more! 😍


### Development setup 👩‍💻

1. 🚀 [Set up your local development environment](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/getting_started/devenv.html)
2. 🐛 [Pick a good first issue](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/labels/good%20first%20issue)
3. 👩‍🔧 Create a branch and make your changes. Remember to sign off your commits using `git commit -sm "Your commit message"`
4. ⬆ Create a [pull request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request) and `@mention` the people from the issue to review
5. 👍 Fix things that come up during review
6. 🎉 Wait for it to get merged!

Third-party components are handled as git submodules which have to be initialized first. So aside from the regular git checkout invoking `git submodule update --init` or a similar command is needed, for details see Git documentation.

Several apps that are included by default in regular releases such as [First run wizard](https://github.com/nextcloud/firstrunwizard) or [Activity](https://github.com/nextcloud/activity) are missing in `master` and have to be installed manually by cloning them into the `apps` subfolder.

Otherwise, git checkouts can be handled the same as release archives, by using the `stable*` branches. Note they should never be used on production systems.


### Building front-end code 🏗

We are moving more and more towards using Vue.js in the frontend, starting with Settings. For building the code on changes, use these terminal commands in the root folder:

``` bash
# install dependencies
make dev-setup

# build for development
make build-js

# build for development and watch edits
make watch-js

# build for production with minification
make build-js-production
```

**When making changes, also commit the compiled files!**

We still use Handlebars templates some places in Files and Settings. We will replace these step-by-step with Vue.js, but in the meantime you need to compile them separately.

If you don’t have Handlebars installed yet, you can do it with this terminal command:
```
sudo npm install -g handlebars
```

Then inside the root folder of your local Nextcloud development installation, run this command in the terminal every time you changed a `.handlebars` file to compile it:
```
./build/compile-handlebars-templates.sh
```


### Tools we use 🛠

- [👀 BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) for cross-browser testing
- [🌊 WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) for accessibility testing
- [🚨 Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) for testing of performance, accessibility and more
