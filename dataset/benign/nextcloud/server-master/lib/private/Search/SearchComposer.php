/**
 * Queries individual \OCP\Search\IProvider implementations and composes a
 * unified search result for the user's search term
 *
 * The search process is generally split into two steps
 *
 *   1. Get a list of provider (`getProviders`)
 *   2. Get search results of each provider (`search`)
 *
 * The reasoning behind this is that the runtime complexity of a combined search
 * result would be O(n) and linearly grow with each provider added. This comes
 * from the nature of php where we can't concurrently fetch the search results.
 * So we offload the concurrency the client application (e.g. JavaScript in the
 * browser) and let it first get the list of providers to then fetch all results
 * concurrently. The client is free to decide whether all concurrent search
 * results are awaited or shown as they come in.
 *
 * @see IProvider::search() for the arguments of the individual search requests
