 * Helper trait to set the ancestor of the file list.

 * The FileListContext provides steps to interact with and check the behaviour
 * of a file list. However, the FileListContext does not know the right file
 * list ancestor that has to be used by the file list steps; this has to be set
 * from other contexts, for example, when the Files app or the public page for a
 * shared folder is opened.
 *
 * Contexts that "know" that certain file list ancestor has to be used by the
 * FileListContext steps should use this trait and call
 * "setFileListAncestorForActor" when needed.
