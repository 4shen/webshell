/**
 * Helper to manage a Nextcloud test server started directly by the acceptance
 * tests themselves using the Apache web server.
 *
 * The Nextcloud test server is executed using the Apache web server; the
 * default Apache directory is expected to have been set to the root directory
 * of the Nextcloud server (for example, by linking "var/www/html" to it); in
 * any case, note that the acceptance tests must be run from the acceptance
 * tests directory. The "setUp" method resets the Nextcloud server to its
 * initial state and starts it, while the "cleanUp" method stops it. To be able
 * to reset the Nextcloud server to its initial state a Git repository must be
 * provided in the root directory of the Nextcloud server; the last commit in
 * that Git repository must provide the initial state for the Nextcloud server
 * expected by the acceptance tests. When the Nextcloud server is reset the
 * owner of "apps", "config" and "data" must be set to the user that Apache
 * server is run as; it is assumed that Apache is run as "www-data".
 *
 * The Nextcloud server is available at "$nextcloudServerDomain", which can be
 * optionally specified when the NextcloudTestServerLocalApacheHelper is
 * created; if no value is given "127.0.0.1" is used by default. In any case,
 * the value of "$nextcloudServerDomain" must be seen as a trusted domain by the
 * Nextcloud server (which would be the case for "127.0.0.1" if it was installed
 * by running "occ maintenance:install"). The base URL to access the Nextcloud
 * server can be got from "getBaseUrl".
