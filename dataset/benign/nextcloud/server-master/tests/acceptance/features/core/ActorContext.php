/**
 * Behat context to set the actor used in sibling contexts.
 *
 * This helper context provides a step definition ("I act as XXX") to change the
 * current actor of the scenario, which makes possible to use different browser
 * sessions in the same scenario.
 *
 * Sibling contexts that want to have access to the current actor of the
 * scenario must implement the ActorAwareInterface; this can be done just by
 * using the ActorAware trait.
 *
 * Besides updating the current actor in sibling contexts the ActorContext also
 * propagates its inherited "base_url" Mink parameter to the Actors as needed.
 *
 * By default no multiplier for the find timeout is set in the Actors. However,
 * it can be customized using the "actorTimeoutMultiplier" parameter of the
 * ActorContext in "behat.yml". This parameter also affects the overall timeout
 * to start a session for an Actor before giving up.
 *
 * Every actor used in the scenarios must have a corresponding Mink session
 * declared in "behat.yml" with the same name as the actor. All used sessions
 * are stopped after each scenario is run.
