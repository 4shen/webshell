/**
 * Wrapper to automatically handle failed commands on Mink elements.
 *
 * Commands executed on Mink elements may fail for several reasons. The
 * ElementWrapper frees the caller of the commands from handling the most common
 * reasons of failure.
 *
 * StaleElementReference exceptions are thrown when the command is executed on
 * an element that is no longer attached to the DOM. This can happen even in
 * a chained call like "$actor->find($locator)->click()"; in the milliseconds
 * between finding the element and clicking it the element could have been
 * removed from the page (for example, if a previous interaction with the page
 * started an asynchronous update of the DOM). Every command executed through
 * the ElementWrapper is guarded against StaleElementReference exceptions; if
 * the element is stale it is found again using the same parameters to find it
 * in the first place.
 *
 * NoSuchElement exceptions are sometimes thrown instead of
 * StaleElementReference exceptions. This can happen when the Selenium2 driver
 * for Mink performs an action on an element through the WebDriver session
 * instead of directly through the WebDriver element. In that case, if the
 * element with the given ID does not exist, a NoSuchElement exception would be
 * thrown instead of a StaleElementReference exception, so those cases are
 * handled like StaleElementReference exceptions.
 *
 * ElementNotVisible exceptions are thrown when the command requires the element
 * to be visible but the element is not. Finding an element only guarantees that
 * (at that time) the element is attached to the DOM, but it does not provide
 * any guarantee regarding its visibility. Due to that, a call like
 * "$actor->find($locator)->click()" can fail if the element was hidden and
 * meant to be made visible by a previous interaction with the page, but that
 * interaction triggered an asynchronous update that was not finished when the
 * click command is executed. All commands executed through the ElementWrapper
 * that require the element to be visible are guarded against ElementNotVisible
 * exceptions; if the element is not visible it is waited for it to be visible
 * up to the timeout set to find it.
 *
 * MoveTargetOutOfBounds exceptions are sometimes thrown instead of
 * ElementNotVisible exceptions. This can happen when the Selenium2 driver for
 * Mink moves the cursor on an element using the "moveto" method of the
 * WebDriver session, for example, before clicking on an element. In that case,
 * if the element is not visible, "moveto" would throw a MoveTargetOutOfBounds
 * exception instead of an ElementNotVisible exception, so those cases are
 * handled like ElementNotVisible exceptions.
 *
 * Despite the automatic handling it is possible for the commands to throw those
 * exceptions when they are executed again; this class does not handle cases
 * like an element becoming stale several times in a row (uncommon) or an
 * element not becoming visible before the timeout expires (which would mean
 * that the timeout is too short or that the test has to, indeed, fail). In a
 * similar way, MoveTargetOutOfBounds exceptions would be thrown again if
 * originally they were thrown because the element was visible but "out of
 * reach".
 *
 * If needed, automatically handling failed commands can be disabled calling
 * "doNotHandleFailedCommands()"; as it returns the ElementWrapper it can be
 * chained with the command to execute (but note that automatically handling
 * failed commands will still be disabled if further commands are executed on
 * the ElementWrapper).
