Bugfix: user:resetpassword with --send-email --password-from-env

When trying to do command:
occ user:resetpassword Anne --send-email --password-from-env

If Anne does not have an email address setup then an error was logged in the
ownCloud log.

This has been corrected. Now the administrator is shown the correct error
"Email address is not set for the user Anne"
