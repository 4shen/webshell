Bugfix: Initialize the user before the transfer command

Trying to transfer the ownership of files to a user who hadn't logged in was causing problems
because the FS of such user wasn't initialized and it wasn't possible to move the files there.
The command appeared to work, but the files weren't moved.

Now such user has the FS initialized so the transfer can be completed normally.
