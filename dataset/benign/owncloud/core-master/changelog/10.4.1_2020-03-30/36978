Bugfix: Avoid unneeded DB connections after a long download

After a long download, we needed to return the filesize, which needed a connection
to the DB. The DB could have ended the connection due to an inactivity timeout.
Now, the filesize is fetched before starting the download, so this timeout shouldn't
happen any longer.
We still need to update the checksum after the download is finished. In this case,
we just log an error message and keep going.
