Bugfix: fix OCS Share API response for requests contain "include_tags" parameter

Sending "include_tags" request parameter for OCS Share API was led to duplicated share entries in API response.
This bug has been fixed by using share_id instead of file_id when populating tags.
Also, the tag generation helper method simplified by customizing it for only shares.
