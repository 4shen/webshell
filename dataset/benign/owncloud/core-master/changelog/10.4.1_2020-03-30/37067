Enhancement: Add new occ command to check the cache for primary storages

This is a new occ command mainly for objectstores (objectstore and files_primary_s3 apps)
as primary storages, but it can be used also for local primary storage.

The use case is when a file is deleted directly from the primary storage without going
through ownCloud. This is a scenario that shouldn't happen (modifying the primary
storage outside of ownCloud isn't supported).

The command will check if the target file can be accessed, and if not you can delete
the information that ownCloud has (the command provides an option for this).

The command will only work for the primary storage. It will ignore files that are
accessible through a share (they need to be accessed directly), or files that are
in an external storage.
