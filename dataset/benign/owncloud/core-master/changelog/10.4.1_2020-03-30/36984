Bugfix: Remove full-stop from end of reset password message

When doing occ user:resetpassword username --password-from-env --send-email
the message "Successfully reset password for username" had a full-stop at the
end. Without --send-email there was no full-stop. The full-stop has been
removed to make the messages consistent.
