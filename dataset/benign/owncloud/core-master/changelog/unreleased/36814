Enhancement: Add new grace period and license management into core

The new grace period allows you to try enterprise apps for 24 hours without
having a valid license key. This grace period will be available only once, and
it will start just right after enabling the first enterprise app. Once the grace
period ends, the enterprise apps will be disabled (unless you have a valid license).

License management has been moved into core and it will replace the enterprise_key
app. There is no big change in the functionality other than a couple of improvements:
The settings page (admin's general section) now has a field to enter your license
key from there, and it will take into account whether the config.php is read-only.
You can also enter a license key from the grace period popup.
