Bugfix: Stop writing data to the output buffer when the connection is not alive

Publicly shared video playback is sending a range http request to get the video
content. In cases where the user is seeking to different positions of the video
will result in a pretty high server load because all the video content is sent
to the browser. Without detecting the connection state on server side all data
is put to the output buffer.
With this change the server processes will stop sending data as soon as the
connection is detected as non-active.
