Bugfix: Add force option to delete user even if the user doesn't exist

When the command:
./occ user:delete -f foo

If the user foo doesn't exist, the "force" option will try to delete
any remnant that such user could have in the system. This includes data,
shares, preferences, etc.
This situation has been detected with some setups after the upgrade of
ownCloud 9 to 10 with user_ldap active.
Note that normal user deletion behaviour will still be used if the user
exists even if the "force" option is used.
