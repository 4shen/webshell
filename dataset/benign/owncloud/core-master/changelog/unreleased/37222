Change: Keep the mtime of files and folders inside the tarball

Previously, when a folder or several files were downloaded, a tarball (.tar for
mac, .zip for windows and linux) was created. Such tarball had the mtime of the
files and folders inside with the time they were added into the tarball, not the
one shown in ownCloud.

This change makes the mtime of the files and folders inside the tarball to be
maintained as they're shown in the ownCloud's FS.
