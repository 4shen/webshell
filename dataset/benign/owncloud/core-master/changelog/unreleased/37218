Bugfix: Ensure ETag changes if a change is detected in a folder

Previously, if a change was detected in a folder, the ETag of the folder only
changed if the folder's mtime changed. The ETag propagation to the root folder
was working fine.
If the folder's mtime didn't change, the ETag of the folder didn't change neither.
This behaviour was causing problems in the desktop client because it was looking for
a change, but it lost track once the client reached the modified folder because the
ETag was the same.
This was detected in the GDrive storage integration. Other storage works without problems.
Basically, the desktop client wasn't able to download newly-added files in GDrive
because it was unable to find where those files were.

The changes fix the problem mentioned above, so the GDrive storage integration keeps
the same behaviour as other external storages
