Bugfix: Allow clearing a user email address or display name

The occ user:modify command would not allow the email or display name of a user
to be cleared. This problem has been fixed.

The email of a user can be cleared with:
occ user:modify <username> email ''

The display name of a user can be cleared with:
occ user:modify <username> displayname ''

And the effective display name reverts to the username.
