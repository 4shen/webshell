Bugfix: Do not notify remote if both owner and sharer are local users

We tried notify remote for all federated shares. When a local share was reshared
as a federated share it caused attempts to notify a local user via federated API.
Under these conditions permission update caused 'Invalid Federated Cloud ID' error
in Web UI. And the sharer was not able to delete the share at his end.
