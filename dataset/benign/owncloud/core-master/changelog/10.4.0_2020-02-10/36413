Bugfix: Set 599 HTTP code on error

Previously, a hard crash, such as DB being down, was being reported with a stacktrace
and a 200 HTTP code. In order to homogenize the behaviour with all the endpoints, we've
changed the behaviour to return a 599 HTTP code and an empty content.

In addition, we've included a new option in the config.php, "crashdirectory", which
defaults to the "datadirectory" set, where the crash logs will be created. Note that
normal errors will still be reported normally and will log into the owncloud.log file.
