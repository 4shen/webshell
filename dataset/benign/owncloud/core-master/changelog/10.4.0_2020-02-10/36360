Enhancement: Regex version for blacklisted_files and excluded_directories

Adds two config options blacklisted_files_regex and excluded_directories_regex
to enable more flexible pattern matches. With this you can, for example, disable
the upload of Microsoft Outlook .pst files or the creation of directories
containing <yourdate>_backup.
