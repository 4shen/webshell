Bugfix: Fix "files:transfer-ownership" in S3 multi-bucket setups

There were problems using the files:transfer-ownership in setups using files_primary_s3
against S3 storage with multibucket configuration, when some of the transferred files
were shared with other people. This PR fixes that problem with the shares while
transferring the files, allowing the files:transfer-ownership to finish correctly
