Enhancement: Additional share owner and initiator info in shares API response

We've extended the OCS Share API response for share recipients to also include
additional fields for the share owner and initiator.
Additional fields are configured in the admin settings and can be set to email or user id
and are useful to distinguish users who have the same display name.
