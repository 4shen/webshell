Enhancement: Add enabled and disabled filter options to occ app:list command

The occ app:list command now supports the --enabled and --disabled options

occ app:list --enabled
Displays just the enabled apps.

occ app:list --disabled
Displays just the disabled apps.

If a disabled app was enabled in the past, then the previously-enabled version
of the app is now displayed in the disabled apps list.
