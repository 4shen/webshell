Enhancement: Enable DAV endpoints for trashbin and for public shares

DAV endpoint for trashbin and DAV endpoint for public shares were released in
ownCloud 10.3.0. The endpoints were disabled by default and had to be enabled
by setting dav.enable.tech_preview in config.php.

These endpoints are now always enabled. There is no longer any need to set
dav.enable.tech_preview in config.php.
