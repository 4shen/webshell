Bugfix: Fix provisioning API request for user information in mixed case

When a user requested their own user information using the provisioning API,
the request URL had to contain the UID in exactly the same case as was used
when the user was created.

The issue has been fixed so that the UID in the request URL is no longer
case-sensitive.
