Bugfix: Receive multiple users for user sync command

Receive multiple users for user sync command. Previously
when multiple users were returned, an exception was thrown
and the command was aborted. In this fix we allow multiple
users to be returned, and we check that the uid provided by the
admin matches with the returned users. And if we find matches
of more than one users with same uid, then we throw the exception
that was thrown previously. The messages are kept intact.
