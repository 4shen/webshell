Bugfix: enhance validation for sender e-mail address for e-mail notifications

If a user wanted to use the e-mail notification mechanism in order to notify other users when creating public links as well as internal shares, an error was triggered if the e-mail address for this user was not set. The behavior has now been fixed.
