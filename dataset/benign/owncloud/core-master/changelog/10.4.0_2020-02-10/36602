Enhancement: reduce memory footprint of trash expiry jobs

The trash expiry job now expires the files in batches of users per script execution,
instead of all users at once. This prevents growing memory related to how PHP PDO
handles memory for many consecutive large queries. The trash expiry has been also
moved to a dedicated trash expiry manager class that is optimized for
background job access, while trash manager is used for online queries. Also some
other minor memory optimizations have been applied.
