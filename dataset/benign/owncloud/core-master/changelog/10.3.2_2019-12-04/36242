Bugfix: Fix SMB access denied error while listing the contents of the folder

This happened in a DFS Replication (DFSr) folder, where such folder was visible even though the user didn't have permissions to read the folder.
Using SMB2, windows threw an access denied error when a normal user was accessing that file.
