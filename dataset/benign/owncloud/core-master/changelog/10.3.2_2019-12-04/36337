Bugfix: Disallow sharing share_folder or it's parents

share_folder had share permission so it was possible for the user to share it along with some received shares.
It caused weird behavior. So sharing share_folder (or any of it's parent folders) was prohibited.
Deleting share_folder was already prohibited, but, the server did not return the correct node permissions.
This situation led to dysfunctionality in client sides. This problem has been fixed.
