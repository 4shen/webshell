	/**
	 * Fix duplicate entries in oc_lucene_status
	 *
	 * search_lucene prior to v0.5.0 did not have a primary key on the lucene_status table. Newer versions do, which
	 * causes the migration check to fail because it tries to insert duplicate rows into the new schema.
	 *
	 * FIXME Currently, apps don't have a way of repairing anything before the migration check:
	 * @link https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/10980
	 *
	 * As a result this repair step needs to live in the core repo, although it belongs into search_lucene:
	 * @link https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/10205#issuecomment-54957557
	 *
	 * It will completely remove any rows that make a file id have more than one status:
	 *  fileid | status                       fileid | status
	 * --------+--------     will become     --------+--------
	 *     2   |   E                             3   |   E
	 *     2   |   I
	 *     3   |   E
	 *
	 * search_lucene will then reindex the fileids without a status when the next indexing job is executed
