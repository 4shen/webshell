Setting the data fingerprint will notify desktop and mobile clients that a server backup has been restored. 
Users will be prompted to resolve any conflicts between newer and older file versions.

Setting the data fingerprint has a large impact on all connected clients!

Only perform this operation if you really know what you are doing.
