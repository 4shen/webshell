  Scenario Outline: delete a file
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "to delete" to "/textfile0.txt"
    When user "Alice" deletes file "/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And as "Alice" file "/textfile0.txt" should not exist
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
      | new         |

  Scenario Outline: delete a file when 2 files exist with different case
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "to delete" to "/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content" to "/TextFile1.txt"
    When user "Alice" deletes file "/textfile1.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And as "Alice" file "/textfile1.txt" should not exist
    And as "Alice" file "/TextFile1.txt" should exist
    And the content of file "/TextFile1.txt" for user "Alice" should be "uploaded content"
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
      | new         |

    And user "Alice" has created folder "<folder_name>"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content for file name with dots" to "<folder_name>/<file_name>"
    When user "Alice" deletes file "<folder_name>/<file_name>" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And as "Alice" file "<folder_name>/<file_name>" should not exist
