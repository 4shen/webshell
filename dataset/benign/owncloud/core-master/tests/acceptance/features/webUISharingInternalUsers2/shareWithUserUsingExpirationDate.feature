Feature: Sharing files and folders with internal users with expiration date set/unset
  As a user
  I want to share files and folders with users with expiration date set
  So that I can provide them temporary access

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Carol" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files

  Scenario: expiration date is disabled for sharing with users, user shares with another user
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/lorem.txt" to "/lorem.txt"
    And parameter "shareapi_default_expire_date_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares file "lorem.txt" with user "Brian" using the webUI without closing the share dialog
    Then the expiration date input field should be visible for the user "Brian" in the share dialog
    And the expiration date input field should be empty for the user "Brian" in the share dialog
    And the information of the last share of user "Alice" should include
      | share_type  | user       |
      | file_target | /lorem.txt |
      | expiration  |            |
      | uid_owner   | Alice      |

  Scenario: expiration date is disabled for sharing with users but enabled for sharing with groups, user shares with another user
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/lorem.txt" to "/lorem.txt"
    And parameter "shareapi_default_expire_date_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And parameter "shareapi_default_expire_date_group_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares file "lorem.txt" with user "Brian" using the webUI without closing the share dialog
    Then the expiration date input field should be visible for the user "Brian" in the share dialog

  Scenario: expiration date is enabled for sharing with users, user shares file with another user
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/lorem.txt" to "/lorem.txt"
    And parameter "shareapi_default_expire_date_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares file "lorem.txt" with user "Brian" using the webUI without closing the share dialog
    Then the expiration date input field should be visible for the user "Brian" in the share dialog
    And the expiration date input field should be "+7 days" for the user "Brian" in the share dialog
    And the information of the last share of user "Alice" should include
      | share_type  | user       |
      | file_target | /lorem.txt |
      | expiration  | +7 days    |
      | uid_owner   | Alice      |

    And parameter "shareapi_expire_after_n_days_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "<num_days>"
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares file "lorem.txt" with user "Brian" using the webUI without closing the share dialog
    Then the expiration date input field should be visible for the user "Brian" in the share dialog
    And the expiration date input field should be "<days>" for the user "Brian" in the share dialog
    And the information of the last share of user "Alice" should include
      | share_type  | user       |
