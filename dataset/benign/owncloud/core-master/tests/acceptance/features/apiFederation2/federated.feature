  Scenario Outline: Incoming federation shares are restricted but outgoing federation shares are allowed
    Given parameter "incoming_server2server_share_enabled" of app "files_sharing" has been set to "no"
    And parameter "outgoing_server2server_share_enabled" of app "files_sharing" has been set to "yes"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file with content "thisContentIsVisible" to "/file-to-share"
    And using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    When user "Brian" from server "LOCAL" shares "/file-to-share" with user "Alice" from server "REMOTE" using the sharing API
    And using server "REMOTE"
    And user "Alice" from server "REMOTE" accepts the last pending share using the sharing API
    Then as "Alice" file "/file-to-share" should exist
