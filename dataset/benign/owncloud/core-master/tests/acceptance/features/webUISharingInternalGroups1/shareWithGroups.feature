Feature: Sharing files and folders with internal groups
  As a user
  I want to share files and folders with groups
  So that those groups can access the files and folders

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Carol" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And these groups have been created:
      | groupname |
      | grp1      |
    And user "Alice" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"
