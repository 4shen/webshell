Feature: Creation of tags
  As a user
  I should be able to create tags
  So that I could categorize my files

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |

  Scenario Outline: Creating a normal tag as regular user should work
    When user "Alice" creates a "normal" tag with name "<tag_name>" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following tags should exist for the administrator
      | name       | type   |
      | <tag_name> | normal |
    And the following tags should exist for user "Alice"
      | name       | type   |
      | <tag_name> | normal |
    Examples:
      | tag_name            |
      | JustARegularTagName |
      | üòÄ                  |
      | ‡§∏‡§ø‡§Æ‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á             |

  Scenario: Creating a not user-assignable tag as regular user should fail
    When user "Alice" creates a "not user-assignable" tag with name "JustARegularTagName" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "400"
    And tag "JustARegularTagName" should not exist for the administrator

  Scenario: Creating a static tag as regular user should fail
    When user "Alice" creates a "static" tag with name "StaticTagName" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "400"
    And tag "StaticTagName" should not exist for the administrator

  Scenario: Creating a not user-visible tag as regular user should fail
    When user "Alice" creates a "not user-visible" tag with name "JustARegularTagName" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "400"
    And tag "JustARegularTagName" should not exist for the administrator

  Scenario: Creating a normal tag as administrator should work
    When the administrator creates a "normal" tag with name "JustARegularTagName" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following tags should exist for the administrator
      | name                | type   |
      | JustARegularTagName | normal |

  Scenario: Creating a not user-assignable tag as administrator should work
    When the administrator creates a "not user-assignable" tag with name "JustARegularTagName" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following tags should exist for the administrator
      | name                | type                |
      | JustARegularTagName | not user-assignable |

  Scenario: Creating a not user-visible tag as administrator should work
    When the administrator creates a "not user-visible" tag with name "JustARegularTagName" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following tags should exist for the administrator
      | name                | type             |
      | JustARegularTagName | not user-visible |

  Scenario: Creating a static tag as administrator should work
    When the administrator creates a "static" tag with name "StaticTagName" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following tags should exist for the administrator
      | name          | type   |
      | StaticTagName | static |

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: Creating a not user-assignable tag with groups as admin should work
    When the administrator creates a "not user-assignable" tag with name "TagWithGroups" and groups "group1|group2" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the "not user-assignable" tag with name "TagWithGroups" should have the groups "group1|group2"

  Scenario: Creating a normal tag with groups as regular user should fail
    When user "Alice" creates a "normal" tag with name "JustARegularTagName" and groups "group1|group2" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "400"
    And tag "JustARegularTagName" should not exist for user "Alice"

  Scenario: Creating a normal tag that is already created by other user should fail
    Given user "Brian" has created a "normal" tag with name "JustARegularTagName"
    When user "Alice" creates a "normal" tag with name "JustARegularTagName" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "409"

  Scenario: Overwriting existing normal tags should fail
    And user "Alice" has created a "normal" tag with name "MyFirstTag"
    When user "Alice" creates a "normal" tag with name "MyFirstTag" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "409"

  Scenario: Overwriting existing not user-assignable tags should fail
    Given the administrator has created a "not user-assignable" tag with name "MyFirstTag"
    When the administrator creates a "not user-assignable" tag with name "MyFirstTag" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "409"

  Scenario: Overwriting existing not user-visible tags should fail
    Given the administrator has created a "not user-visible" tag with name "MyFirstTag"
    When the administrator creates a "not user-visible" tag with name "MyFirstTag" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "409"

  Scenario: Overwriting existing static tags should fail
    Given the administrator has created a "static" tag with name "StaticTag"
    When the administrator creates a "static" tag with name "StaticTag" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "409"
