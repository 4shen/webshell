Feature: Deletion of tags
  As a user
  I want to delete the tags that are already created

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: Deleting a normal tag as regular user should work
    Given the administrator has created a "normal" tag with name "JustARegularTagName"
    When user "Alice" deletes the tag with name "JustARegularTagName" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And tag "JustARegularTagName" should not exist for the administrator

  Scenario: Deleting a normal tag that has already been assigned to a file should work
    Given user "Alice" has created a "normal" tag with name "JustARegularTagName"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/myFileToTag.txt"
    And user "Alice" has added tag "JustARegularTagName" to file "/myFileToTag.txt"
    When user "Alice" deletes the tag with name "JustARegularTagName" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And tag "JustARegularTagName" should not exist for the administrator
    And file "/myFileToTag.txt" should have no tags for user "Alice"

  Scenario: Deleting a not user-assignable tag as regular user should fail
    Given the administrator has created a "not user-assignable" tag with name "JustARegularTagName"
    When user "Alice" deletes the tag with name "JustARegularTagName" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And the following tags should exist for the administrator
      | name                | type                |
      | JustARegularTagName | not user-assignable |

  Scenario: Deleting a not user-visible tag as regular user should fail
    Given the administrator has created a "not user-visible" tag with name "JustARegularTagName"
    When user "Alice" deletes the tag with name "JustARegularTagName" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "404"
    And the following tags should exist for the administrator
      | name                | type             |
      | JustARegularTagName | not user-visible |

  Scenario: Deleting a static tag as regular user should fail
    Given the administrator has created a "static" tag with name "StaticTagName"
    When user "Alice" deletes the tag with name "StaticTagName" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And the following tags should exist for the administrator
      | name          | type   |
      | StaticTagName | static |

  Scenario: Deleting a not user-assignable tag as admin should work
