Feature: a subfolder of a received share can be reshared

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: User is allowed to reshare a sub-folder with the same permissions
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    And user "Carol" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/TMP"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/TMP/SUB"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/TMP" with user "Brian" with permissions "share,read"
    When user "Brian" shares folder "/TMP/SUB" with user "Carol" with permissions "share,read" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And as "Carol" folder "/SUB" should exist
    And as "Brian" file "/TMP/SUB" should exist
    Examples:
      | ocs_api_version | ocs_status_code |
      | 1               | 100             |
      | 2               | 200             |

  Scenario Outline: User is not allowed to reshare a sub-folder with more permissions
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    And user "Carol" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/TMP"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/TMP/SUB"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/TMP" with user "Brian" with permissions <received_permissions>
    When user "Brian" shares folder "/TMP/SUB" with user "Carol" with permissions <reshare_permissions> using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "404"
    And the HTTP status code should be "<http_status_code>"
    And as "Carol" folder "/SUB" should not exist
    But as "Brian" file "/TMP/SUB" should exist
    Examples:
      | ocs_api_version | http_status_code | received_permissions | reshare_permissions |
      # try to pass on more bits including reshare
