Feature: Display notifications when receiving a share
  As a user
  I want to see notifications about shares that have been offered to me
  So that I can easily decide what I want to do with new received shares

  Background:
    Given app "notifications" has been enabled
    And using OCS API version "1"
    And using new DAV path
    And these users have been created with default attributes and skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And these groups have been created:
      | groupname |
      | grp1      |
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Carol" has been added to group "grp1"

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: share to user sends notification
    Given parameter "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    When user "Alice" shares folder "/PARENT" with user "Brian" using the sharing API
    And user "Alice" shares file "/textfile0.txt" with user "Brian" using the sharing API
    Then user "Brian" should have 2 notifications
    And the last notification of user "Brian" should match these regular expressions about user "Alice"
      | key         | regex                                           |
      | app         | /^files_sharing$/                               |
      | subject     | /^"%displayname%" shared "PARENT" with you$/     |
      | message     | /^"%displayname%" invited you to view "PARENT"$/ |
      | link        | /^%base_url%(\/index\.php)?\/f\/(\d+)$/         |
      | object_type | /^local_share$/                                 |

  Scenario: share to group sends notification to every member
    Given parameter "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"

    And user "Alice" shares file "/textfile0.txt" with group "grp1" using the sharing API
    Then user "Brian" should have 2 notifications
    And the last notification of user "Brian" should match these regular expressions about user "Alice"

	# This scenario documents behavior discussed in core issue 31870
	# An old share keeps its old auto-accept behavior, even after auto-accept has been disabled.
  @skipOnLDAP
  Scenario: share to group does not send notifications to either existing or new members for an old share created before auto-accept is disabled
    Given user "Alice" has shared folder "/PARENT" with group "grp1"
    When the administrator sets parameter "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" to "no"
    And the administrator creates user "David" using the provisioning API
    And the administrator adds user "David" to group "grp1" using the provisioning API
    Then user "Brian" should have 0 notifications
    And user "Carol" should have 0 notifications
    And user "David" should have 0 notifications

	# This scenario documents behavior discussed in core issue 31870
	# As users are added to an existing group, they are not sent notifications about group shares.
