  Scenario: send MKCOL requests to webDav endpoints using token authentication should not work
    Given token auth has been enforced
    And a new browser session for "Alice" has been started

    When the user requests these endpoints with "MKCOL" using the generated app password then the status codes about user "Alice" should be as listed

    When the user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "MKCOL" using the basic auth and generated app password then the status codes about user "Alice" should be as listed
