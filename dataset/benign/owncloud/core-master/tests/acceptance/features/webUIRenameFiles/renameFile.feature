Feature: rename files
  As a user
  I want to rename files
  So that I can organise my data structure

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: Rename a file using special characters
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some content" to "/randomfile.txt"
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user renames file "randomfile.txt" to <to_file_name> using the webUI
    Then file <to_file_name> should be listed on the webUI
    When the user reloads the current page of the webUI
    Then file <to_file_name> should be listed on the webUI
    Examples:
      | to_file_name           |
      | 'लोरेम।तयक्स्त? $%#&@' |
      | '"quotes1"'            |
      | "'quotes2'"            |
      | "?quot=OC&OC2 #OC%  3" |

  Scenario Outline: user with unusual username renames a file using special characters

    When the user renames file "randomfile.txt" to "लोरेम।तयक्स्त? $%#&@" using the webUI
    Then file "लोरेम।तयक्स्त? $%#&@" should be listed on the webUI
    When the user reloads the current page of the webUI
    Then file "लोरेम।तयक्स्त? $%#&@" should be listed on the webUI
    Examples:
      | username |
      | user-1   |
      | null     |
      | nil      |
      | 123      |
