Feature: move (rename) file
  As a user
  I want to be able to move and rename files
  So that I can manage my file system

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files

  Scenario Outline: Moving a file
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" moves file "/textfile0.txt" to "/FOLDER/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions for user "Alice"
      | ETag | /^"[a-f0-9:]{1,32}"$/ |
    And the content of file "/FOLDER/textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file 0" plus end-of-line
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
      | new         |
