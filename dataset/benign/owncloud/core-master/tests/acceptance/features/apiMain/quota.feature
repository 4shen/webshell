	# Owner

  Scenario: Uploading a file as owner having enough quota
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And the quota of user "Alice" has been set to "10 MB"
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to filenames based on "/testquota.txt" with all mechanisms using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code of all upload responses should be "201"

  Scenario: Uploading a file as owner having insufficient quota
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And the quota of user "Alice" has been set to "20 B"
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to filenames based on "/testquota.txt" with all mechanisms using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code of all upload responses should be "507"
    Then as "Alice" the files uploaded to "/testquota.txt" with all mechanisms should not exist

  Scenario: Overwriting a file as owner having enough quota
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "test" to "/testquota.txt"
    And the quota of user "Alice" has been set to "10 MB"
    When user "Alice" overwrites from file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to file "/testquota.txt" with all mechanisms using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code of all upload responses should be between "201" and "204"
