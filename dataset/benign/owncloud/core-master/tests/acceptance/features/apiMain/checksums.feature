Feature: checksums

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  Scenario Outline: Uploading a file with checksum should work
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/myChecksumFile.txt" with checksum "MD5:d70b40f177b14b470d1756a3c12b963a" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    Examples:
