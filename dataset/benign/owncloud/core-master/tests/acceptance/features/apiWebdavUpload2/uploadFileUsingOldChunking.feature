Feature: upload file using old chunking
  As a user
  I want to be able to upload "large" files in chunks
  So that the upload can be completed in less elapsed time

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And using old DAV path
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files

  @issue-36115
  Scenario: Upload chunked file asc
    When user "Alice" uploads the following "3" chunks to "/myChunkedFile.txt" with old chunking and using the WebDAV API
      | number | content |
      | 1      | AAAAA   |
      | 2      | BBBBB   |
      | 3      | CCCCC   |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the following headers should match these regular expressions for user "Alice"
      #| ETag | /^"[a-f0-9:]{1,32}"$/ |
      | ETag | /^[a-f0-9:]{1,32}$/ |
    Then as "Alice" file "/myChunkedFile.txt" should exist
    And the content of file "/myChunkedFile.txt" for user "Alice" should be "AAAAABBBBBCCCCC"

  Scenario: Upload chunked file desc
    When user "Alice" uploads the following "3" chunks to "/myChunkedFile.txt" with old chunking and using the WebDAV API
      | number | content |
      | 3      | CCCCC   |
      | 2      | BBBBB   |
      | 1      | AAAAA   |
    Then as "Alice" file "/myChunkedFile.txt" should exist
    And the content of file "/myChunkedFile.txt" for user "Alice" should be "AAAAABBBBBCCCCC"

  Scenario: Upload chunked file random
    When user "Alice" uploads the following "3" chunks to "/myChunkedFile.txt" with old chunking and using the WebDAV API
      | number | content |
      | 2      | BBBBB   |
      | 3      | CCCCC   |
      | 1      | AAAAA   |
    Then as "Alice" file "/myChunkedFile.txt" should exist
    And the content of file "/myChunkedFile.txt" for user "Alice" should be "AAAAABBBBBCCCCC"

  Scenario: Checking file id after a move overwrite using old chunking endpoint
    Given the owncloud log level has been set to debug
    And the owncloud log has been cleared
    And user "Alice" has copied file "/textfile0.txt" to "/existingFile.txt"
    And user "Alice" has stored id of file "/existingFile.txt"
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/existingFile.txt" in 3 chunks with old chunking and using the WebDAV API
    Then user "Alice" file "/existingFile.txt" should have the previously stored id
    And the content of file "/existingFile.txt" for user "Alice" should be:
      """
      This is a testfile.

      Cheers.
      """
    And the log file should not contain any log-entries containing these attributes:
      | app |
      | dav |

  Scenario Outline: Chunked upload files with difficult name

    And the content of file "/<file-name>" for user "Alice" should be:
