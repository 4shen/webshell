Feature: restrict Sharing
  As an admin
  I want to be able to restrict the sharing function
  So that users can only share files with specific users and groups

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And these groups have been created:
      | groupname |
      | grp1      |
      | grp2      |
    And user "Alice" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Carol" has been added to group "grp2"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Brian" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Brian" has logged in using the webUI
