@webUI @insulated @disablePreviews
Feature: disable sharing
  As an admin
  I want to be able to disable the sharing function
  So that users cannot share files

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  @TestAlsoOnExternalUserBackend
  @smokeTest
  Scenario: Users tries to share via WebUI when Sharing is disabled
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And the setting "Allow apps to use the Share API" in the section "Sharing" has been disabled
    When user "Alice" logs in using the webUI
    Then it should not be possible to share folder "simple-folder" using the webUI
