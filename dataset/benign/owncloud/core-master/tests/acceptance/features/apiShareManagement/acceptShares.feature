Feature: accept/decline shares coming from internal users
  As a user
  I want to have control of which received shares I accept
  So that I can keep my file system clean

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And using new DAV path
    And these users have been created with default attributes and skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And group "grp1" has been created
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Carol" has been added to group "grp1"

  Scenario Outline: share a file & folder with another internal user with different permissions when auto accept is enabled
    Given parameter "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    When user "Alice" creates a share using the sharing API with settings
      | path        | PARENT        |
      | shareType   | user          |
      | shareWith   | Brian         |
      | permissions | <permissions> |
    And user "Alice" shares file "/textfile0.txt" with user "Brian" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And user "Brian" should see the following elements
      | /FOLDER/                 |
      | /PARENT/                 |
      | /PARENT%20(2)/           |
      | /PARENT%20(2)/parent.txt |
      | /textfile0.txt           |
      | /textfile0%20(2).txt     |
    And the sharing API should report to user "Brian" that these shares are in the accepted state
      | path               |
      | /PARENT (2)/       |
      | /textfile0 (2).txt |
    And  the downloaded content when downloading file "/PARENT (2)/CHILD/child.txt" for user "Brian" with range "bytes=19-28" should be "file child"
    And  the downloaded content when downloading file "/textfile0 (2).txt" for user "Brian" with range "bytes=14-24" should be "text file 0"
    Examples:
      | permissions |
      | read        |
      | change      |
      | all         |

    When user "Alice" shares folder "/PARENT" with user "Brian" using the sharing API
    And user "Alice" shares file "/textfile0.txt" with user "Brian" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And user "Brian" should see the following elements
      | /FOLDER/                               |

      | /textfile0.txt                         |
      | <top_folder>/textfile0<suffix>.txt     |
    And the sharing API should report to user "Brian" that these shares are in the accepted state
      | path                                  |
      | <top_folder>/<received_parent_name>/  |
      | <top_folder>/<received_textfile_name> |
