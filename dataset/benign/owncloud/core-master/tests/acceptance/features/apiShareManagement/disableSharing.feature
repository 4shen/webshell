Feature: sharing
  As an admin
  I want to be able to disable sharing functionality
  So that ownCloud users cannot share file or folder

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: user tries to share a file with another user when the sharing api has been disabled
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    When parameter "shareapi_enabled" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    Then user "Alice" should not be able to share file "welcome.txt" with user "Brian" using the sharing API
    And the OCS status code should be "404"
    And the HTTP status code should be "<http_status_code>"
    Examples:
      | ocs_api_version | http_status_code |
      | 1               | 200              |
