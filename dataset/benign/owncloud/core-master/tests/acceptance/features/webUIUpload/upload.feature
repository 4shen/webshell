Feature: File Upload

  As a user
  I would like to be able to upload files via the WebUI
  So that I can store files in ownCloud

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: simple upload of a file that does not exist before
    Given user "<username>" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "<username>" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user uploads file "new-lorem.txt" using the webUI
    Then no notification should be displayed on the webUI
    And file "new-lorem.txt" should be listed on the webUI
    And the content of "new-lorem.txt" should be the same as the local "new-lorem.txt"
    Examples:
      | username |
      | user-1   |
      | null     |
      | nil      |
      | 123      |
      | -123     |
      | 0.0      |
