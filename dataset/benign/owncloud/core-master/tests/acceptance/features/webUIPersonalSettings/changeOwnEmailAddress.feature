  Scenario: Change email address
    When the user changes the email address to "new-address@owncloud.com" using the webUI
    And the user follows the email change confirmation link received by "new-address@owncloud.com" using the webUI
    Then the attributes of user "Alice" returned by the API should include
      | email | new-address@owncloud.com |
