Feature: a default expiration date can be specified for shares with users or groups

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files

  @skipOnOcV10.3
  Scenario Outline: sharing with default expiration date enabled but not enforced for users, user shares without specifying expireDate
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    And parameter "shareapi_default_expire_date_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    When user "Alice" shares folder "/FOLDER" with user "Brian" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "<http_status_code>"
    And the fields of the last response to user "Alice" should include
      | expiration |  |
    And the response when user "Brian" gets the info of the last share should include
      | expiration |  |
    Examples:
      | ocs_api_version | ocs_status_code | http_status_code |
      | 1               | 100             | 200              |
