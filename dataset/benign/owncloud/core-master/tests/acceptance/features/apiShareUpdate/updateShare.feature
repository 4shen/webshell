  Scenario Outline: Allow modification of reshare
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Brian    |

    And user "Alice" has created folder "/TMP"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "TMP" with user "Brian"

    When user "Brian" updates the last share using the sharing API with
      | permissions | read |
