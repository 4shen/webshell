Feature: admin apps settings
  As an admin
  I want to be able to manage apps settings on the ownCloud server
  So that I can enable or disable apps on the ownCloud server

  Background:
    Given the administrator has browsed to the admin apps settings page

  @smokeTest @TestAlsoOnExternalUserBackend
  Scenario: admin disables an app
    Given app "comments" has been enabled
    When the administrator disables app "comments" using the webUI
    Then app "comments" should be disabled

    Given app "comments" has been disabled
    And the administrator has browsed to the disabled apps page
