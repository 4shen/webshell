Feature: move files
  As a user
  I want to move files
  So that I can organise my data structure

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    And the user has browsed to the files page

  Scenario: An attempt to move a file into a sub-folder using rename is not allowed
    When the user renames file "data.zip" to "simple-folder/data.zip" using the webUI
    Then near file "data.zip" a tooltip with the text 'File name cannot contain "/".' should be displayed on the webUI

    When the user browses to the files page
    And the user moves file "data.tar.gz" into folder "strängé नेपाली folder empty" using the webUI
    Then file "data.tar.gz" should not be listed on the webUI

    And the user moves file "data.zip" into folder "strängé नेपाली folder" using the webUI
    Then notifications should be displayed on the webUI with the text
