  @smokeTest @skipOnLDAP
  Scenario Outline: adding a user to a group
    Given user "brand-new-user" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And group "<group_id>" has been created
    When the administrator adds user "brand-new-user" to group "<group_id>" using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    Examples:
      | group_id    | comment                               |
      | simplegroup | nothing special here                  |
      | Espa√±a¬ß√†√¥≈ì‚Ç¨ | special European and other characters |
      | ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä      | Unicode group name                    |

  Scenario Outline: adding a user to a group that has a forward-slash in the group name
    Given user "brand-new-user" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    # After fixing issue-31015, change the following step to "has been created"
    And the administrator sends a group creation request for group "<group_id>" using the provisioning API
    #And group "<group_id>" has been created
    When the administrator adds user "brand-new-user" to group "<group_id>" using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    # The following step is needed so that the group does get cleaned up.
    # After fixing issue-31015, remove the following step:
    And the administrator deletes group "<group_id>" using the occ command
    Examples:
      | group_id         | comment                            |
      | Mgmt/Sydney      | Slash (special escaping happens)   |
