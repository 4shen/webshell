Feature: get subadmin groups
  As an admin
  I want to be able to get the groups in which the user is subadmin
  So that I can know in which groups the user has administrative rights

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: admin gets subadmin groups of a user
    Given user "brand-new-user" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And group "brand-new-group" has been created
    And group "ğŸ˜… ğŸ˜†" has been created
    And user "brand-new-user" has been made a subadmin of group "brand-new-group"
    And user "brand-new-user" has been made a subadmin of group "ğŸ˜… ğŸ˜†"
    When the administrator gets all the groups where user "brand-new-user" is subadmin using the provisioning API
    Then the subadmin groups returned by the API should be
      | brand-new-group |
      | ğŸ˜… ğŸ˜†     |
    And the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"

  Scenario: admin tries to get subadmin groups of a user which do not exist
    Given user "nonexistentuser" has been deleted
    And group "brand-new-group" has been created
    When the administrator gets all the groups where user "nonexistentuser" is subadmin using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "101"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the API should not return any data
