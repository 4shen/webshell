Feature: remove a user from a group
  As an admin
  I want to be able to remove a user from a group
  So that I can manage user access to group resources

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: admin removes a user from a group
    Given user "brand-new-user" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And group "<group_id>" has been created
    And user "brand-new-user" has been added to group "<group_id>"
    When the administrator removes user "brand-new-user" from group "<group_id>" using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And user "brand-new-user" should not belong to group "<group_id>"
    Examples:
      | group_id        | comment                               |
      | brand-new-group | nothing special here                  |
      | Espa√±a¬ß√†√¥≈ì‚Ç¨     | special European and other characters |
      | ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä          | Unicode group name                    |

  @issue-31015
  Scenario Outline: admin removes a user from a group that has a forward-slash in the group name
    Given user "brand-new-user" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    # After fixing issue-31015, change the following step to "has been created"
    And the administrator sends a group creation request for group "<group_id>" using the provisioning API
    #And group "<group_id>" has been created
    And user "brand-new-user" has been added to group "<group_id>"
    When the administrator removes user "brand-new-user" from group "<group_id>" using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And user "brand-new-user" should not belong to group "<group_id>"
    # The following step is needed so that the group does get cleaned up.
    # After fixing issue-31015, remove the following step:
    And the administrator deletes group "<group_id>" using the occ command
    Examples:
      | group_id         | comment                            |
      | Mgmt/Sydney      | Slash (special escaping happens)   |

      | priv/subadmins/1 | Subadmins mentioned not at the end |

  Scenario Outline: remove a user from a group using mixes of upper and lower case in user and group names

    And group "<group_id3>" has been created
    And user "brand-new-user" has been added to group "<group_id1>"
    And user "brand-new-user" has been added to group "<group_id2>"
    And user "brand-new-user" has been added to group "<group_id3>"
    When the administrator removes user "<user_id>" from group "<group_id1>" using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And user "brand-new-user" should not belong to group "<group_id1>"
    But user "brand-new-user" should belong to group "<group_id2>"
    And user "brand-new-user" should belong to group "<group_id3>"
    Examples:
      | user_id        | group_id1   | group_id2   | group_id3   |
