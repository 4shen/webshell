  Scenario Outline: admin deletes a group
    Given group "<group_id>" has been created
    When the administrator deletes group "<group_id>" using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And group "<group_id>" should not exist
    Examples:
      | group_id    | comment                               |
      | simplegroup | nothing special here                  |
      | Espa√±a¬ß√†√¥≈ì‚Ç¨ | special European and other characters |
      | ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä      | Unicode group name                    |

  Scenario Outline: group names are case-sensitive, the correct group is deleted
    Given group "<group_id1>" has been created
    And group "<group_id2>" has been created
    And group "<group_id3>" has been created
    When the administrator deletes group "<group_id1>" using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And group "<group_id1>" should not exist
    But group "<group_id2>" should exist
    And group "<group_id3>" should exist
    Examples:
      | group_id1            | group_id2            | group_id3            |
      | case-sensitive-group | Case-Sensitive-Group | CASE-SENSITIVE-GROUP |
      | Case-Sensitive-Group | CASE-SENSITIVE-GROUP | case-sensitive-group |
      | CASE-SENSITIVE-GROUP | case-sensitive-group | Case-Sensitive-Group |

  @issue-31015
  Scenario Outline: admin deletes a group that has a forward-slash in the group name
    # After fixing issue-31015, change the following step to "has been created"
    Given the administrator sends a group creation request for group "<group_id>" using the provisioning API
    #Given group "<group_id>" has been created
    When the administrator deletes group "<group_id>" using the provisioning API
    # After fixing issue-31015, change the expected status to "100"
    #Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "404"
    #And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And group "<group_id>" should not exist
    # The following step is needed so that the group does get cleaned up.
    # After fixing issue-31015, remove the following step:
    And the administrator deletes group "<group_id>" using the occ command
    Examples:
      | group_id         | comment                            |
      | Mgmt/Sydney      | Slash (special escaping happens)   |
      | Mgmt//NSW/Sydney | Multiple slash                     |
      | var/../etc       | using slash-dot-dot                |

  Scenario: normal user tries to delete the group
    Given user "brand-new-user" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And group "brand-new-group" has been created
    And user "brand-new-user" has been added to group "brand-new-group"
    When user "brand-new-user" tries to delete group "brand-new-group" using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "997"
    And the HTTP status code should be "401"
    And group "brand-new-group" should exist

  Scenario: subadmin of the group tries to delete the group
    Given user "subadmin" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And group "brand-new-group" has been created
    And user "subadmin" has been made a subadmin of group "brand-new-group"
    When user "subadmin" tries to delete group "brand-new-group" using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "997"
    And the HTTP status code should be "401"
