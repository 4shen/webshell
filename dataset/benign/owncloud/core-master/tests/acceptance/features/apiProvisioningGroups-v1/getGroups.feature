Feature: get groups
  As an admin
  I want to be able to get groups
  So that I can see all the groups in my ownCloud

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"

  @smokeTest @skipOnLdap @issue-ldap-500
  Scenario: admin gets all the groups
    Given group "0" has been created
    And group "brand-new-group" has been created
    And group "España" has been created
    When the administrator gets all the groups using the provisioning API
    Then the groups returned by the API should be
      | España          |
      | admin           |
      | brand-new-group |
      | 0               |

  @skipOnLdap @issue-ldap-499
  Scenario: admin gets all the groups, including groups with mixed case
    Given group "case-sensitive-group" has been created
    And group "Case-Sensitive-Group" has been created
    And group "CASE-SENSITIVE-GROUP" has been created
    When the administrator gets all the groups using the provisioning API
    Then the groups returned by the API should be
      | admin                |
      | case-sensitive-group |
      | Case-Sensitive-Group |
      | CASE-SENSITIVE-GROUP |
