Feature: delete users
  As an admin
  I want to delete users
  So that I can remove users

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and skeleton files but not initialized:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And the administrator has logged in using the webUI
    And the administrator has browsed to the users page

  Scenario: use the webUI to delete a simple user
    When the administrator deletes user "Alice" using the webUI and confirms the deletion using the webUI
    And the deleted user "Alice" tries to login using the password "%password%" using the webUI
    Then the user should be redirected to a webUI page with the title "%productname%"
    When the user has browsed to the login page
    And user "Brian" logs in using the webUI
    Then the user should be redirected to a webUI page with the title "Files - %productname%"

  Scenario: use the webUI to cancel deletion of user
    When the administrator deletes user "Alice" using the webUI and cancels the deletion using the webUI
    Then user "Alice" should exist

  Scenario Outline:  user names are not case-sensitive, deleting users with different upper and lower case names
    When the administrator creates a user with the name "<user_id1>" and the password "password" using the webUI
    Then user "<user_id1>" should exist
    And user "<user_id2>" should exist
    When the administrator deletes user "<user_id1>" using the webUI and confirms the deletion using the webUI
    Then user "<user_id1>" should not exist
    And user "<user_id2>" should not exist
    Examples:
      | user_id1       | user_id2       |
      | Brand-New-User | brand-new-user |
      | brand-new-user | Brand-New-User |
      | Brand-New-User | BRAND-NEW-USER |
