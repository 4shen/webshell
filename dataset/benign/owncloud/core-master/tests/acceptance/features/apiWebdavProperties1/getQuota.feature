Feature: get quota
  As a user
  I want to be able to find out my available storage quota
  So that I can manage the use of my allocated storage

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files

  Scenario Outline: Retrieving folder quota when no quota is set
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    When the administrator gives unlimited quota to user "Alice" using the provisioning API
    Then as user "Alice" folder "/" should contain a property "d:quota-available-bytes" with value "-3"
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
      | new         |
