Feature: security certificates
  As an admin
  I want to be able to manage the ownCloud security certificates
  So that I can ensure the proper encrpytion mechanism

  Scenario: Import a security certificate
    When the administrator imports security certificate from the path "tests/data/certificates/goodCertificate.crt"
    Then the command should have been successful
    When the administrator invokes occ command "security:certificates"
    Then the command should have been successful
    And the command output table should contain the following text:
      | table_column        |
      | goodCertificate.crt |

  Scenario: List security certificates when multiple certificates are imported
    Given the administrator has imported security certificate from the path "tests/data/certificates/goodCertificate.crt"
    And the administrator has imported security certificate from the path "tests/data/certificates/badCertificate.crt"
    When the administrator invokes occ command "security:certificates"
    And the command output table should contain the following text:
      | table_column        |
      | goodCertificate.crt |
      | badCertificate.crt  |

  Scenario: Remove a security certificate
    Given the administrator has imported security certificate from the path "tests/data/certificates/goodCertificate.crt"
    And the administrator has imported security certificate from the path "tests/data/certificates/badCertificate.crt"
    When the administrator removes the security certificate "goodCertificate.crt"
    Then the command should have been successful
    When the administrator invokes occ command "security:certificates"
    And the command output table should contain the following text:
      | table_column       |
      | badCertificate.crt |
