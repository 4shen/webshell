Feature: access user provisioning API using app password
  As an ownCloud user
  I want to be able to use the provisioning API with an app password
  So that I can make a client app or script for provisioning users/groups that can use an app password instead of my real password.

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: admin deletes the user
    Given user "brand-new-user" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And group "brand-new-group" has been created
    And a new client token for the administrator has been generated
    And a new browser session for the administrator has been started
    And the user has generated a new app password named "my-client"
    When the user requests "/ocs/v1.php/cloud/users/brand-new-user" with "DELETE" using the generated app password
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And user "brand-new-user" should not exist

  Scenario: subadmin gets users in their group
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and skeleton files:
      | username         |
      | brand-new-user   |
      | another-new-user |
    And group "brand-new-group" has been created
    And user "another-new-user" has been added to group "brand-new-group"
    And user "brand-new-user" has been made a subadmin of group "brand-new-group"
    And a new client token for "brand-new-user" has been generated
    And a new browser session for "brand-new-user" has been started
    And the user has generated a new app password named "my-client"
    When the user requests "/ocs/v1.php/cloud/users" with "GET" using the generated app password
    Then the users returned by the API should be
      | another-new-user |
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: normal user gets their own information using the app password
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and skeleton files:
      | username       | displayname |
      | brand-new-user | New User    |
    And a new client token for "brand-new-user" has been generated
    And a new browser session for "brand-new-user" has been started
    And the user has generated a new app password named "my-client"
    When the user requests "/ocs/v1.php/cloud/users/brand-new-user" with "GET" using the generated app password
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the display name returned by the API should be "New User"

  Scenario: subadmin tries to get users of other group
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and skeleton files:
      | username         |
      | brand-new-user   |
      | another-new-user |
    And group "brand-new-group" has been created
    And group "another-new-group" has been created
    And user "another-new-user" has been added to group "another-new-group"
    And user "brand-new-user" has been made a subadmin of group "brand-new-group"
    And a new client token for "brand-new-user" has been generated
    And a new browser session for "brand-new-user" has been started
    And the user has generated a new app password named "my-client"
    When the user requests "/ocs/v1.php/cloud/users" with "GET" using the generated app password
    Then the users returned by the API should not include "another-new-user"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"

  Scenario: normal user tries to get other user information using the app password
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and skeleton files:
      | username         |
      | brand-new-user   |
      | another-new-user |
    And a new client token for "brand-new-user" has been generated
    And a new browser session for "brand-new-user" has been started
    And the user has generated a new app password named "my-client"
    When the user requests "/ocs/v1.php/cloud/users/another-new-user" with "GET" using the generated app password
    Then the OCS status code should be "997"
    And the HTTP status code should be "401"
    And the API should not return any data
