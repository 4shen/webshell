Feature: cannot share resources with invalid permissions

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/PARENT"

  Scenario Outline: Cannot create a share of a file or folder with invalid permissions
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    When user "Alice" creates a share using the sharing API with settings
      | path        | <item>        |
      | shareWith   | Brian         |
      | shareType   | user          |
      | permissions | <permissions> |
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "<http_status_code>"
    And as "Brian" entry "<item>" should not exist
    Examples:
      | ocs_api_version | ocs_status_code | http_status_code | item          | permissions |
      | 1               | 400             | 200              | textfile0.txt | 0           |
