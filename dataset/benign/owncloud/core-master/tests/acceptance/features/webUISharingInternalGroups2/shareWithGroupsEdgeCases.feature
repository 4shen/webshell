Feature: Sharing files and folders with internal groups
  As a user
  I want to share files and folders with groups
  So that those groups can access the files and folders

  Background:
	Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
	  | username |
	  | Alice    |
	  | Brian    |
	And user "Carol" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files

  Scenario Outline: sharing  files and folder with an internal problematic group name
    Given these groups have been created:
      | groupname |
      | <group>   |
    And user "Alice" has been added to group "<group>"
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "<group>"
    And user "Carol" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with group "<group>" using the webUI
    And the user shares file "testimage.jpg" with group "<group>" using the webUI
    And the user re-logs in as "Alice" using the webUI
    Then folder "simple-folder" should be listed on the webUI
    And folder "simple-folder" should be marked as shared with "<group>" by "Carol" on the webUI
    And file "testimage.jpg" should be listed on the webUI
    And file "testimage.jpg" should be marked as shared with "<group>" by "Carol" on the webUI
    When the user re-logs in as "Brian" using the webUI
    Then folder "simple-folder" should be listed on the webUI
    And folder "simple-folder" should be marked as shared with "<group>" by "Carol" on the webUI
    And file "testimage.jpg" should be listed on the webUI
    And file "testimage.jpg" should be marked as shared with "<group>" by "Carol" on the webUI
    Examples:
      | group     |
      | ?\?@#%@,; |
      | नेपाली    |
