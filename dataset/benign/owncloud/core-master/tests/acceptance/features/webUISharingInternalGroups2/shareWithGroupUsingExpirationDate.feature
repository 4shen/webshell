Feature: Sharing files and folders with internal groups with expiration date set/unset
  As a user
  I want to share files and folders with groups and set an expiration date
  So that I can provide them temporary access

  As a administrator
  I want to set default expiration dates and be able to enforce them
  So that a user cannot have endless shares

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And user "Carol" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And these groups have been created:
      | groupname |
      | grp1      |
    And user "Alice" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"

  Scenario: expiration date is disabled for sharing with groups, user shares with a group
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/lorem.txt" to "/lorem.txt"
    And parameter "shareapi_default_expire_date_group_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares file "lorem.txt" with group "grp1" using the webUI without closing the share dialog
    Then the expiration date input field should be visible for the group "grp1" in the share dialog
    And the expiration date input field should be empty for the group "grp1" in the share dialog
    And the information of the last share of user "Alice" should include
      | share_type  | group      |
      | file_target | /lorem.txt |
      | expiration  |            |
      | uid_owner   | Alice      |

  Scenario: expiration date is disabled for sharing with groups but enabled for sharing with users, user shares with a group
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/lorem.txt" to "/lorem.txt"
    And parameter "shareapi_default_expire_date_group_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And parameter "shareapi_default_expire_date_user_share" of app "core" has been set to "yes"
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares file "lorem.txt" with group "grp1" using the webUI without closing the share dialog
    Then the expiration date input field should be visible for the group "grp1" in the share dialog
    And the expiration date input field should be empty for the group "grp1" in the share dialog
    And the information of the last share of user "Alice" should include
      | share_type  | group      |
      | file_target | /lorem.txt |
      | expiration  |            |
      | uid_owner   | Alice      |

  Scenario: expiration date is enabled for sharing with groups, user shares a file with a group

    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares file "lorem.txt" with group "grp1" using the webUI without closing the share dialog
    Then the expiration date input field should be visible for the group "grp1" in the share dialog
    And the expiration date input field should be "+7 days" for the group "grp1" in the share dialog
    When the user changes expiration date for share of group "grp1" to "+3 days" in the share dialog
    Then the expiration date input field should be "+3 days" for the group "grp1" in the share dialog
    And the information of the last share of user "Alice" should include
      | share_type  | group      |
      | file_target | /lorem.txt |
      | expiration  | +3 days    |
      | uid_owner   | Alice      |

  Scenario Outline: expiration date is enforced for group, user shares a file
