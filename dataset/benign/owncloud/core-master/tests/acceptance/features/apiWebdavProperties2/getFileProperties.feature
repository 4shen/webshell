Feature: get file properties
  As a user
  I want to be able to get meta-information about files
  So that I can know file meta-information (detailed requirement TBD)

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: Do a PROPFIND of various file names
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content" to "<file_name>"
    When user "Alice" gets the properties of file "<file_name>" using the WebDAV API
    Then the properties response should contain an etag
    Examples:
      | dav_version | file_name         |
      | old         | /upload.txt       |
      | old         | /strängé file.txt |

      | new         | /strängé file.txt |
      | new         | /नेपाली.txt       |
