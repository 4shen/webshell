Feature: previews of files downloaded through the webdav API

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  @skipOnOcis @issue-ocis-200
  Scenario Outline: download previews of different sizes
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/lorem.txt" to "/parent.txt"
    When user "Alice" downloads the preview of "/parent.txt" with width <width> and height <height> using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the downloaded image should be <width> pixels wide and <height> pixels high
    Examples:
      | width | height |
      | 1     | 1      |
      | 32    | 32     |
      | 1024  | 1024   |
