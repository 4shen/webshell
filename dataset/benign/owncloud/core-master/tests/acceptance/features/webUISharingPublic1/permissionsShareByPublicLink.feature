Feature: Share by public link
  As a user
  I want to share files through a publicly accessible link
  So that users who do not have an account on my ownCloud server can access them

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

    When the user creates a new public link for folder "simple-folder" using the webUI with
      | permission | read-write |
    And the public accesses the last created public link using the webUI
    And the user deletes the following elements using the webUI
      | name                                  |
