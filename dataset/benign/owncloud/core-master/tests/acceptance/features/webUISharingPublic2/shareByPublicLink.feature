Feature: Share by public link
  As a user
  I want to share files through a publicly accessible link
  So that users who do not have an account on my ownCloud server can access them

  As an admin
  I want to limit the ability of a user to share files/folders through a publicly accessible link
  So that public sharing is limited according to organization policy
