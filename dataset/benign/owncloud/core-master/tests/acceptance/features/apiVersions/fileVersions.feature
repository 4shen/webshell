  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "2"
    And using new DAV path
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  Scenario: Upload file and no version is available
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/davtest.txt" to "/davtest.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the version folder of file "/davtest.txt" for user "Alice" should contain "0" elements

  Scenario: Upload file and no version is available using various chunking methods
    When user "Alice" uploads file "filesForUpload/davtest.txt" to filenames based on "/davtest.txt" with all mechanisms using the WebDAV API

    And user "Brian" has uploaded file with content "test data 2" to "/testshare/testfile.txt"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file with content "test data 3" to "/testshare/testfile.txt"
    And user "Brian" has created a share with settings
      | path        | testshare |
      | shareType   | user      |
      | permissions | change    |
      | shareWith   | Alice     |
    When user "<mover>" moves file "/testshare/testfile.txt" to "/testfile.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And the content of file "/testfile.txt" for user "<mover>" should be "test data 3"
    And as "Alice" file "/testshare/testfile.txt" should not exist
    And as "Brian" file "/testshare/testfile.txt" should not exist
    And the version folder of file "/testfile.txt" for user "<mover>" should contain "2" elements
    Examples:
      | dav_version | mover |
      | old         | Alice |
      | new         | Alice |
      | old         | Brian |
      | new         | Brian |
