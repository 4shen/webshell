Feature: Creation of tags for the files and folders
  As a user
  I want to create tags for the files/folders
  So that I can find them easily

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
    And user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI

  Scenario: Create a new tag that does not exist for a file in the root
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some content" to "/randomfile.txt"
    When the user browses directly to display the details of file "randomfile.txt" in folder "/"
    And the user adds a tag "Top Secret" to the file using the webUI
    And the user adds a tag "Confidential" to the file using the webUI
    Then file "/randomfile.txt" should have the following tags for user "Alice"
      | name         | type   |
      | Top Secret   | normal |
      | Confidential | normal |

  Scenario: Create a new tag that does not exist for a file in a folder
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "a-folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some content" to "/a-folder/randomfile.txt"
    When the user browses directly to display the details of file "randomfile.txt" in folder "a-folder"
    And the user adds a tag "Top Secret" to the file using the webUI
    And the user adds a tag "Top" to the file using the webUI
    Then file "a-folder/randomfile.txt" should have the following tags for user "Alice"
      | name       | type   |
      | Top Secret | normal |
      | Top        | normal |

  Scenario: Add a new tag that already exists for a file in a folder
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "a-folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some content" to "/a-folder/randomfile.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some content" to "/a-folder/randomfile-big.txt"
    And the user has created a "normal" tag with name "randomfile"
    And the user has added tag "randomfile" to file "/a-folder/randomfile.txt"
    When the user browses directly to display the details of file "randomfile-big.txt" in folder "a-folder"
    And the user adds a tag "randomfile" to the file using the webUI
    Then file "a-folder/randomfile.txt" should have the following tags for user "Alice"
      | name       | type   |
      | randomfile | normal |
    And file "a-folder/randomfile-big.txt" should have the following tags for user "Alice"
      | name       | type   |
