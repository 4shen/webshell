Feature: Autocompletion of share-with names
  As a user
  I want to share files, with minimal typing, to the right people or groups
  So that I can efficiently share my files with other users or groups

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with skeleton files:
      | username               | password  | displayname   | email        |
      | autocomplete-test-user | %regular% | Thomas Krause | ur@oc.net.np |
      | another-test-user      | %regular% | Another Name  | an@oc.com.np |
    # Some extra users without skeleton files to make the share autocompletion interesting
    And these users have been created without skeleton files:
      | username   | password  | displayname     | email          |
      | jb1        | %regular% | James Baker     | jb@oc.com.np   |
      | u444       | %regular% | Four            | u4@oc.com.np   |
      | five       | %regular% | User Five       | five@oc.net.np |
      | usersmith  | %regular% | John Finn Smith | js@oc.com.de   |
      | anne-smith | %regular% | Anne Smith      | as@oc.com.au   |
    And these groups have been created:
      | groupname     |
      | finance1      |
      | finance2      |
      | finance3      |
      | users-finance |
      | other         |
    And the administrator has added system config key "user_ldap.enable_medial_search" with value "true" and type "boolean"
