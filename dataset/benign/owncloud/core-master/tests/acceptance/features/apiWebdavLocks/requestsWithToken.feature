Feature: actions on a locked item are possible if the token is sent with the request

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: rename a file in a locked folder
    Given using <dav-path> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has locked folder "PARENT" setting following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    When user "Alice" moves file "/PARENT/parent.txt" to "/PARENT/renamed-file.txt" sending the locktoken of folder "PARENT" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/parent.txt" should not exist
    But as "Alice" file "/PARENT/renamed-file.txt" should exist
    Examples:
      | dav-path | lock-scope |
      | old      | shared     |
      | old      | exclusive  |
      | new      | shared     |
      | new      | exclusive  |

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: move a file into a locked folder
    Given using <dav-path> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has locked folder "FOLDER" setting following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    When user "Alice" moves file "/PARENT/parent.txt" to "/FOLDER/moved-file.txt" sending the locktoken of folder "FOLDER" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/parent.txt" should not exist
    But as "Alice" file "/FOLDER/moved-file.txt" should exist
    Examples:
      | dav-path | lock-scope |
      | old      | shared     |
      | old      | exclusive  |
      | new      | shared     |
      | new      | exclusive  |

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: move a file into a locked folder is impossible when using the wrong token
    Given using <dav-path> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has locked folder "FOLDER" setting following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    And user "Alice" has locked folder "PARENT/CHILD" setting following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    When user "Alice" moves file "/PARENT/parent.txt" to "/FOLDER/moved-file.txt" sending the locktoken of folder "PARENT/CHILD" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "423"
    And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/parent.txt" should exist
    But as "Alice" file "/FOLDER/moved-file.txt" should not exist
    Examples:
      | dav-path | lock-scope |
      | old      | shared     |
      | old      | exclusive  |
      | new      | shared     |
      | new      | exclusive  |

  @issue-34338 @files_sharing-app-required
  Scenario Outline: share receiver cannot rename a file in a folder locked by the owner even when sending the locktoken
    Given using <dav-path> DAV path
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "PARENT" with user "Brian"
    And user "Alice" has locked folder "PARENT" setting following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    When user "Brian" moves file "PARENT (2)/parent.txt" to "PARENT (2)/renamed-file.txt" sending the locktoken of file "PARENT" of user "Alice" using the WebDAV API
    #When the issue is fixed, remove the following steps and replace with the commented-out steps
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/parent.txt" should not exist
    But as "Alice" file "/PARENT/renamed-file.txt" should exist
    #Then the HTTP status code should be "423"
    #And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/parent.txt" should exist
    #But as "Alice" file "/PARENT/renamed-file.txt" should not exist
    Examples:
      | dav-path | lock-scope |
      | old      | shared     |
      | old      | exclusive  |
      | new      | shared     |
      | new      | exclusive  |

  Scenario Outline: public cannot overwrite a file in a folder locked by the owner even when sending the locktoken
    Given the administrator has enabled DAV tech_preview
    And user "Alice" has created a public link share of folder "PARENT" with change permission
    And user "Alice" has locked folder "PARENT" setting following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    When the public uploads file "parent.txt" with content "test" sending the locktoken of file "PARENT" of user "Alice" using the old public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "423"
    When the public uploads file "parent.txt" with content "test" sending the locktoken of file "PARENT" of user "Alice" using the new public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "412"
    And the content of file "/PARENT/parent.txt" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file parent" plus end-of-line
    Examples:
      | lock-scope |
      | shared     |
      | exclusive  |

  @issue-34360 @files_sharing-app-required
  Scenario Outline: two users having both a shared lock can use the resource
    Given using <dav-path> DAV path
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has shared file "textfile0.txt" with user "Brian"
    And user "Alice" has locked file "textfile0.txt" setting following properties
      | lockscope | shared |
    And user "Brian" has locked file "textfile0 (2).txt" setting following properties
      | lockscope | shared |
    When user "Alice" uploads file with content "from user 0" to "textfile0.txt" sending the locktoken of file "textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "423"
    And the content of file "textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file 0" plus end-of-line
    And the content of file "textfile0 (2).txt" for user "Brian" should be "ownCloud test text file 0" plus end-of-line
    When user "Brian" uploads file with content "from user 1" to "textfile0 (2).txt" sending the locktoken of file "textfile0 (2).txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "423"
    And the content of file "textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "ownCloud test text file 0" plus end-of-line
    And the content of file "textfile0 (2).txt" for user "Brian" should be "ownCloud test text file 0" plus end-of-line
    #Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    #And the content of file "textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "from user 0"
    #And the content of file "textfile0 (2).txt" for user "Brian" should be "from user 0"
    #When user "Brian" uploads file with content "from user 1" to "textfile0 (2).txt" sending the locktoken of file "textfile0 (2).txt" using the WebDAV API
    #Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    #And the content of file "textfile0.txt" for user "Alice" should be "from user 1"
    #And the content of file "textfile0 (2).txt" for user "Brian" should be "from user 1"
