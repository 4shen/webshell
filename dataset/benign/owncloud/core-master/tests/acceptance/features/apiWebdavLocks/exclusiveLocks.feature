Feature: there can be only one exclusive lock on a resource

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files

  Scenario Outline: a second lock cannot be set on a folder when its exclusively locked
    Given using <dav-path> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has locked file "textfile0.txt" setting following properties
      | lockscope | exclusive |
    When user "Alice" locks file "textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API setting following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "423"
    And 1 locks should be reported for file "textfile0.txt" of user "Alice" by the WebDAV API
    Examples:
      | dav-path | lock-scope |
      | old      | shared     |
      | old      | exclusive  |
      | new      | shared     |
      | new      | exclusive  |

  Scenario Outline: if a parent resource is exclusively locked a child resource cannot be locked again
    Given using <dav-path> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has locked folder "PARENT" setting following properties
      | lockscope | exclusive |
    When user "Alice" locks folder "PARENT/CHILD" using the WebDAV API setting following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "423"
    And 1 locks should be reported for file "PARENT/CHILD/child.txt" of user "Alice" by the WebDAV API
    Examples:
      | dav-path | lock-scope |
      | old      | shared     |
      | old      | exclusive  |
      | new      | shared     |
      | new      | exclusive  |

  Scenario Outline: if a parent resource is exclusively locked with depth 0 a child resource can be locked again
    Given using <dav-path> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has locked folder "PARENT" setting following properties
      | lockscope | exclusive |
      | depth     | 0         |
    When user "Alice" locks folder "PARENT/CHILD" using the WebDAV API setting following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And 1 locks should be reported for file "PARENT/CHILD/child.txt" of user "Alice" by the WebDAV API
    Examples:
      | dav-path | lock-scope |
      | old      | shared     |
      | old      | exclusive  |
      | new      | shared     |
      | new      | exclusive  |
