  Scenario Outline: User is not allowed to reshare file when reshare permission is not given
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    And user "Alice" has shared file "/textfile0.txt" with user "Brian" with permissions "read,update"
    When user "Brian" shares file "/textfile0.txt" with user "Carol" with permissions "read,update" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "404"
    And the HTTP status code should be "<http_status_code>"
    And as "Carol" file "/textfile0.txt" should not exist
    But as "Brian" file "/textfile0.txt" should exist
    Examples:
      | ocs_api_version | http_status_code |
      | 1               | 200              |
      | 2               | 404              |

  Scenario Outline: User is not allowed to reshare folder when reshare permission is not given
