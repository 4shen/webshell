*************************
Connect to external hosts
*************************


Connecting from inside a Devilbox Docker container to any external host works out of the box.
The only thing you need is internet/network access and know its hostname or IP address.

Each container has internet access, thus you can ``curl``, ``fetch``, connect to or download
any online resources from within the container.
