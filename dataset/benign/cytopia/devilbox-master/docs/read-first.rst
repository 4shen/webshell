Find some useful information and tips for the documentation itself.

Shell commands
==============

.. important::

   All shell commands in this documentation use two different formats:

   1. This one indicates that the command should be executed on your host operating system. (When copying commands, do not copy the ``host>`` part).

   .. code-block:: bash

      host> command

   2. This one indicates that the command should be executed inside the currently selected PHP container.  (When copying commands, do not copy the ``php>`` part).

   .. code-block:: bash

      php> command


Examples
========

.. note::

   Most examples to configure your host operating system will be presented for Linux by default,
   there will however always be links for how to accomplish the same on Windows and MacOS.


Checklists
==========

.. note::
   Most guides and tutorials provide a **Checklist** at the very bottom.
   You can jump to it and quickly see if you have done everything already.


Where to start?
===============

On the left menu you will find a ``GETTING STARTED`` section, **read through all of them** to get
a basic theoretical and practical understanding about the Devilbox.

There is also a :ref:`blogs_videos_and_use_cases` section that might be useful as an additional crash-course.
