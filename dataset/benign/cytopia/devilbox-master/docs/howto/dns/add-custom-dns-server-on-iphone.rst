separately. There is no need to install external Apps.

Change DNS server with Third-Party App
======================================

If the above does not work for you or you just want another App that makes it even easier to change
DNS settings, you can search the AppStore for many available DNS changer Apps. They also work
on non-rooted iPhones.
