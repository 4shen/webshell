 * To support custom removal of files during an upgrade process take the following steps:
 *
 * 1) Extend this class and save the PHP file name to be the same as the class name
 * 2) Override the getFilesToRemove method to return an Array of files/directories to remove
 * 3) Place this PHP file in custom/scripts/files_to_remove directory of your SugarCRM install
 *
 * The UpgradeRemoval instance will be invoked from the unlinkUpgradeFiles method of uw_utils.php
