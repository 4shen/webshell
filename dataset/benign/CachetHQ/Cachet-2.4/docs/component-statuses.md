# Component Statuses

Unlike Incidents, Cachet starts listing Component statuses from 1.
When creating or updating a component, you'll need to specify a status for it.

A status can be one of the following:

Status|Name|Description
------|----|-----------
1|Operational|The component is working
2|Performance issues|The component is experiencing some slowness.
3|Partial Outage|The component may not be working for everybody. This could be a geographical issue for example.
4|Major outage|The component is not working for anybody.
