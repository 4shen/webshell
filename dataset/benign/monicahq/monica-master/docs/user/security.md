# Security

If the option is set, you can add a [Multi Factor Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) device to secure your connection.

You can either:

- add a 2FA security device, using an OTP application on your mobile phone
- or add a [Security Key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor) key. Monica provides [WebAuthn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn) support. It's supported on most recent browsers. Be aware the instance must run in `https`.
