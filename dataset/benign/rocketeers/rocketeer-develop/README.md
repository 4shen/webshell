**Rocketeer** is a modern PHP task runner and deployment package. It is inspired by the [Laravel Framework](http://laravel.com/) philosophy and thus aims to be fast, elegant, and more importantly easy to use.

Like the latter, emphasis is put on smart defaults and modern development. While it is coded in PHP, it can deploy any project from small HTML/CSS websites to large Rails applications.

## Main features

- **Versatile**, support for multiple connections, multiserver connections, multiple stages per server, etc.
- **Fast**, queue tasks and run them in parallel across all your servers and stages
- **Modulable**, not only can you add custom tasks and components, every core part of Rocketeer can be hot swapped, extended, hacked to bits, etc.
- **Preconfigured**, tired of defining the same routines again and again ? Rocketeer is made for modern development and comes with smart defaults and built-in tasks such as installing your application's dependencies
- **Powerful**, releases management, server checks, rollbacks, etc. Every feature you'd expect from a deployment tool is there

## Installation

The fastest way is to grab the binary:

```bash
$ wget http://rocketeer.autopergamene.eu/versions/rocketeer.phar
$ chmod +x rocketeer.phar
$ mv rocketeer.phar /usr/local/bin/rocketeer
```

More ways to setup Rocketeer can be found in the [official documentation](http://rocketeer.autopergamene.eu/#/docs/docs/I-Introduction/Getting-started).

## Why not Capistrano?

That's a question that's been asked to me, why not simply use Capistrano? I've used Capistrano in the past, it does everything you want it to do, that's a given.

But, it remains a Ruby package and one that's tightly coupled to Rails in some ways; Rocketeer makes it so that you don't have Ruby files hanging around your app. That way you configure it once and can use it wherever you want in the realm of your application, even outside of the deploy routine.
It's also meant to be a lot easier to comprehend, for first-time users or novices, Capistrano is a lot to take in at once – Rocketeer aims to be as simple as possible by providing smart defaults and speeding up the time between installing it and first hitting `deploy`.

It's also more thought out for the PHP world – although you can configure Capistrano to run Composer and PHPUnit, that's not something it expects from the get go, while those tasks that are a part of every PHP developer are integrated in Rocketeer's core deploy process.
