# User facing changes

*   {leadfield=...} tokens were removed. Use {contactfield=...} tokens instead.
*   Supported PHP versions are 7.2 and 7.3
*   Console was moved to another directory. Update all your cron job and replace app/console with bin/console
*   There is a new file manager. You can see it when you go to a WYSIWYG editor and try to add an image for example.
*   The Rackspace and OpenStack plugins for remote assets were removed due to outdated library from Rackspace.

# New features

* The Integrations Bundle that was being developed in a separate repository ([https://github.com/mautic-inc/plugin-integrations](https://github.com/mautic-inc/plugin-integrations)) was moved into the core bundles into app/bundles directory. It is meant to replace the current way how integrations are being handled by the Plugin Bundle.
* Mautic's Configuration is no longer dependent on Symfony's container. This means the container file does not have to be deleted and rebuilt after saving Mautic's Configuration. However, this also means that any parameter that is used in a cache compiler pass is no longer compatible with the UI and must be manually configured in local.php. See Configuration below for more information and BC changes as a result.

# Backwards compatibility breaking changes

*   Minimal PHP version was increased from v5.6.19 to v7.2.0.
*   Minimal MySQL version was increased from v5.5.3 to v5.7.14
*   Symfony deprecations were removed or refactored [https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.0/UPGRADE-3.0.md](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.0/UPGRADE-3.0.md)
*   Migrating the database should be done by upgrading to the latest 2.x series then to M3 as all 2.x migrations have been removed from the 3.x code
*   jQuery v2.x has been replaced with jQuery v3.3.1. jQuery 2.x code is not supported anymore..
*   app/version.txt has beeen removed in favor of app/release_metadata.json which includes the version
*   `\AppKernel::MAJOR_VERSION`, `\AppKernel::MINOR_VERSION`, `\AppKernel::PATCH_VERSION`, and `\AppKernel::EXTRA_VERSION` are no longer defined. Use `\Mautic\CoreBundle\Release\ThisRelease::getMetadata()->getMajorVersion()`, etc instead. 

### Subscribers

*   Do not extend CommonSubscriber. It was removed. Use direct DI instead.
*   All protected properties and methods were made private. Subscribers should not be used to extend another ones. There are 2 exceptions. See bellow.
*   StatsSubscribers extend abstract class Mautic\CoreBundle\EventListener\CommonStatsSubscriber. Those subscribers must have protected properties.
*   DashboardSubscribers extend abstract class Mautic\DashboardBundle\EventListener\DashboardSubscriber\DashboardSubscriber. Those subscribers must have protected properties.
*   Subscribers that extend abstract class Mautic\QueueBundle\EventListener\AbstractQueueSubscriber must keep protected properties.

### Configuration

In Mautic 3, several configuration parameters have changed (`app/config/local.php`). The [upgrade script](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/issues/8819) will update those automatically for you, but here's an overview of parameters that will be updated by the script:

| Key | Old value | New value | Comment
|---|---|---|---|
| mailer_transport | 'mail' | 'sendmail' | 'mail' option was removed in SwiftMailer 6, other options should keep working as-is
| system_update_url | 'https://updates.mautic.org/ index.php?option=com_mauticdownload& task=checkUpdates' | 'https://api.github.com/ repos/mautic/mautic/releases' | New update mechanism
| dev_hosts | null | array() | If this was set to null, it should now be an empty array
| theme | 'Mauve' | 'blank' | Mauve theme was removed in 3.x (already deprecated for a while)
| track_by_fingerprint | 0 | N/A | Functionality removed in 3.x
| webhook_start | '0' | N/A | Removed in 3.x
| cache_path | 'YOUR_MAUTIC_FOLDER/ app/cache' | 'YOUR_MAUTIC_FOLDER/ app/../var/cache' | We'll only change the default value (new location is var/cache) but leave any custom configs intact
| log_path | 'YOUR_MAUTIC_FOLDER/ app/logs' | 'YOUR_MAUTIC_FOLDER/ app/../var/logs' | We'll only change the default value (new location is var/logs) but leave any custom configs intact
| tmp_path | 'YOUR_MAUTIC_FOLDER/ app/cache' | 'YOUR_MAUTIC_FOLDER/ app/../var/tmp' | We'll only change the default value (new location is var/tmp, it has its own dedicated folder now) but leave any custom configs intact
| mailer_spool_path | '%kernel.root_dir%/spool' | '%kernel.root_dir%/../var/spool' | We'll only change the default value (new location is var/spool) but leave any custom configs intact
| api_rate_limiter_cache | 'type' => 'file_system' | 'adapter' => 'cache.adapter.filesystem' | See below |

**Note on the `api_rate_limiter_cache` parameter**: this is an advanced feature that we only expect a very small subset of users to be using currently. 

If you had a custom API rate limiter other than the filesystem (default), you'll need to specify a [Symfony cache adapter](https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/cache.html#configuring-cache-with-frameworkbundle) as of Mautic 3. **The upgrade script will change it to 'cache.adapter.filesystem' to prevent issues in the upgrade process, so you should change it yourself post-upgrade**.  For example, if you had Memcached set up with the following configuration:

```PHP
'api_rate_limiter_cache' => array(
  'memcached' => array(
    'servers' => array(
      '0' => array(
        'host' => 'memcached.local',
          'port' => '12345'
      )
    )
  )
),
```
... it should now be:

```PHP
'api_rate_limiter_cache' => array(
  'adapter' => 'cache.adapter.memcached',
  'provider' => 'memcached://memcached.local:12345'
),
```

In case you've been using `$_SERVER['MAUTIC_DEV_HOSTS']` to add more allowed IP addresses for the development enviroment, there had to be 2 changes because it was conflicting with handling configuration with environment variables.
1. Change `MAUTIC_DEV_HOSTS` to `MAUTIC_CUSTOM_DEV_HOSTS`.
2. It's not a string anymore, but a JSON encoded array.

Before:
```
$_SERVER['MAUTIC_DEV_HOSTS'] = '1.2.3.4';
```

After:
```
$_SERVER['MAUTIC_CUSTOM_DEV_HOSTS'] = '["1.2.3.4"]';
```

#### Removing the Container as a Configuration Dependency
Mautic's Configuration is no longer dependent on the Symfony container. This means that any parameter that has to be used in a cache compiler pass is no longer compatible with the UI. These "advanced" configuration options have to be manually set in the local.php file then delete Mautic's cache. For example, the QueueBundle must now be manually configured due to its dependency on cache compilers.

The following changes were made to support this:
1. `%mautic.parameters%` is no longer available to services. Use the `CoreParametersHelper` instead.
2. `CoreParametersHelper` is now limited to _just_ Mautic configuration parameters. It can no longer be used to fetch other Symfony parameters, `mautic.paths`, `mautic.supported_languages`, `mautic.bundles`, or `mautic.plugin.bundles`. Pass them as needed to the constructor of the service, use the BundleHelper, LanguageHelper, or the PathsHelper instead.
3. Email spooling was not compatible with dynamic environment variables. Thus a new service was created to delegate whether an email should be spooled or sent immediately.
4. Mautic\CoreBundle\Helper\CacheHelper::clearCache(), clearContainerFile(), clearTranslationCache(), and clearRoutingCache() were removed.

### PHPUNIT tests

PHPUNIT was upgraded to version 7.5.0 which means that the namespaces changed. See [https://thephp.cc/news/2017/02/migrating-to-phpunit-6](https://thephp.cc/news/2017/02/migrating-to-phpunit-6) for more details. 

The database fixtures are being installed based on the class name instead of the file path. Example:

Mautic 2 (how it was before):

```
$this->installDatabaseFixtures([dirname(__DIR__).'/../../../../../app/bundles/LeadBundle/DataFixtures/ORM/LoadLeadData.php']);
```

Mautic 3 (how it should be now): 
```
$this->installDatabaseFixtures([\Mautic\LeadBundle\DataFixtures\ORM\LeadFieldData::class]);
```
All fixtures must be defined as services in a bundle's config.php

# Other

*   Form type classes getName() methods should be renamed (not removed) to getBlockPrefix() method to save some issues with JS files which use form input ID selectors.
*   `setOptional` method in form types is deprecated. Please use `setDefined` method instead.
*   choice_list must be changed to choices, and the value of class ChoiceType has to be replaced with choices and an array with _labels_ as keys; there’s a bug in Symfony 2.8 that you also have to set ‘choices_as_values’ => true to ensure that labels and values are correct. 
*   Some use of choices for ChoiceType in Mautic 2 is dependent on the Symfony 2.8 bc break and need to have the key/values flipped. See [https://symfony.com/doc/2.8/reference/forms/types/choice.html#choices-as-values](https://symfony.com/doc/2.8/reference/forms/types/choice.html#choices-as-values)
*   $view[‘router’]->generate() in PHP templates has to be changed to $view[‘router’]->url()
*   [sensio/generator-bundle](https://packagist.org/packages/sensio/generator-bundle) package was removed from the dev dependencies as it's abandoned.
*   [symfony/browser-kit](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/browser_kit.html) package was moved from the prod into dev dependencies as it's supposed to be used for functional tests.
*   [symfony/dom-crawler](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dom_crawler.html) package was moved from the prod into dev dependencies as it's supposed to be used for functional tests.
