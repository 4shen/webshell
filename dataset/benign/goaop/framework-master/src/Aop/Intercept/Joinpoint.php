 * This interface represents a generic runtime joinpoint (in the AOP terminology).
 *
 * A runtime joinpoint is an event that occurs on a static joinpoint (i.e. a location in a the program).
 * For instance, an invocation is the runtime joinpoint on a method (static joinpoint).
 * The static part of a given joinpoint can be generically retrieved using the getStaticPart() method.
 *
 * In the context of an interception framework, a runtime joinpoint is then the reification of an access to
 * an accessible object (a method, a constructor, a field), i.e. the static part of the joinpoint. It is passed
 * to the interceptors that are installed on the static joinpoint.
