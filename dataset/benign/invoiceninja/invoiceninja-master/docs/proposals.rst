Proposals
=========

When submitting a regular quote is not enough, the advanced Proposals feature comes to the rescue.

Proposals are a powerful sales and marketing tool to present your offer for a gig. Whether you're competing against other providers, or you want to make a fantastic impression, the proposal function is a great way to custom-create a personalized proposal containing all the information you need to convey.

The proposals feature is based on grapesjs.com, which enables HTML and CSS management. This advanced tool gives experienced programmers the freedom to create customized, professional proposals with ease, directly within Invoice Ninja, integrating your quote information with one click.

There are three key parts to creating proposals: Proposals, Templates and Snippets. Let's explore them one by one.

Proposals
"""""""""

Each proposal is based on a quote. In order to create a proposal, you'll first need to create a quote.

To create a quote, click on New Quote on the Quotes list page, or click the + sign on the Quotes tab in the main sidebar. Once you've created the quote, go to the Proposals list page by clicking on the Proposals tab in the main sidebar.

Proposals List Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Proposals list page features a table of all active proposals and corresponding information.

The table consists of the following data columns:

- **Quote**: Every proposal is based on a quote. This is the quote number of the corresponding quote.
- **Client**: The client's name.
- **Template**: The template assigned to the proposal.
- **Date created**: The date the proposal was created.
- **Content**: A short preview of the content/topic of the proposal.
- **Private notes**: Any notes to yourself included in the proposal (these are hidden from the client; only you can see them).
- **Action column**: The action column has a drop-down menu with the option to Edit, Archive or Delete the proposal. To select an action, hover in the action column and click to open the drop-down menu.

Archive / Delete Proposal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you wish to archive or delete a proposal, select the action in the column corresponding to the relevant quote. Once you select Archive or Delete, the proposal will be removed from the table.

.. TIP:: You can also archive a proposal by checking the box to the left of the quote number of the relevant proposal. Then click the Archive button at the top left of the Proposals table.

By default, the Proposals list page will display only active proposals in the table. To view archived or deleted proposals, you need to update the list in the labels field, situated at the top left of the Proposals table, to the right of the gray Archive button.

Click inside the labels field to open the drop-down menu. Then, select Archived and/or Deleted from the menu. The table will automatically refresh to display Archived/Deleted proposals. Archived proposals will display an orange "Archived" label and Deleted proposals will display a red "Deleted" label in the action column.

**To restore an Archived or Deleted Proposal**

First, display the proposal by updating the table to view Archived or Deleted proposals. Then, open the drop-down menu in the action column of the relevant proposal. Click Restore proposal.

New Proposal
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a new proposal, click the blue New Proposal + button located at the top right of the Proposals list page. The Proposals/ Create page will open.

.. TIP:: You can create a new proposal from anywhere in the site by clicking the + icon on the Proposals tab on the static sidebar menu at the left of the screen.

Before beginning to work on the proposal design, you'll need to complete the fields in the top section of the page:

- **Quote**: A proposal must be based on an existing quote. To select the quote, click the arrow in the Quote field, and choose the relevant quote from the drop-down menu.
- **Template**: Select the template you wish to use for the proposal by clicking the arrow in the Template field. Choose the relevant template from the drop-down menu.
- **Private notes**: This is an optional field. You can enter notes and comments. They are for your eyes only; all private notes remain hidden from the client.

Now you're ready to design the proposal. You'll be working on the 'canvas' with the proposal editor, rich in design tools to custom create attractive, professional-looking proposals.

The proposal layout is based on the template you choose. Any information contained in the corresponding quote will be automatically embedded in the proposal.

Let's explore the proposal editor toolbar, from right to left:

- **Grid Editor**: When you create a new proposal, the toolbar will be set by default to the far-right icon – the grid editor. Proposals are built on a grid-like canvas. To insert sections, text blocks, icons, links and more, drag and drop the item from the selection that appears in the grid editor, in the sidebar at the right of the canvas.
- **Options button**: Navigation menu that takes you through each design element in the proposal.
- **Component Settings**: Displays the component ID that gives identifying information about the component.
- **Style Manager**: Provides style information and editing options for each design element – Dimensions, Typography and Decorations.
- **Undo/ Redo buttons**: You can undo or redo your last action by clicking on these buttons.
- **Toggle Images**: Turn images in your proposal on or off.
- **Import Template**: Import an external template to apply to the proposal.
- **View Code**: Click to open a window that displays the proposal's code.
- **FullScreen**: Click to work in full screen mode. Click again to return to normal screen.
- **View Components**: Click to display all the components of the proposal.

View Modes
^^^^^^^^^^

At the top left of the proposal canvas, there is a view mode bar that allows you to view the proposal in desktop, tablet or mobile size. Click on the desktop, tablet or mobile icon to choose the view mode.

When You Finish Working on the Proposal

When you've finished designing the proposal, you can choose from three options:

- **Cancel**: Don't like your work? Don't need the proposal after all? Click the gray Cancel button to discard the proposal.
- **Save**: Save a draft to work on or send later by clicking on the green Save button. The proposal will appear in the Proposals table on the Proposals list page.
- **Email**: If you're ready to present the proposal to your client, click the orange Email button. The proposal will be sent to the client's email address.

Templates

Templates enable you to quickly apply standard layout and design features, saving time and making the proposal creation process more efficient.

You can also custom design your own templates, from scratch or based on an existing template.

Snippets
""""""""

Snippets are pre-defined content elements that you can create and reuse in your proposals over and over. Instead of designing parts of your proposal every time from scratch, you can save snippets, which you can then insert in any proposal with just a click. This saves you tons of time and effort, so you can create proposals faster. For example, you may want to include a short bio about yourself in every proposal. Create a snippet of your bio, and add it to proposals anywhere, anytime you want.

When you create a snippet, it will appear in the right sidebar in the proposal editor.
