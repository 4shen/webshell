Clients
=======

They come in all shapes and sizes. They’re the reason you go to work in the morning. There are new ones coming up, and old ones coming back. What you need is a well-maintained, up-to-date, comprehensive client list to keep your invoicing in order.

Your clients are the core of your freelance business, and your Clients page is the core of your activity on Invoice Ninja.

List Clients
""""""""""""

The Clients page is a list page that presents a summary of all your clients in a user-friendly table. Think of your Clients page as the “central station” of your client activity. Most of your day-to-day invoicing actions can be taken from the various links and buttons that appear on the Clients list page. And you can use the Clients list page as your starting point to explore more in-depth client information, edit client information, view current client statements, and more. Now, we’ll take a closer look at the setup of the Clients page, and the range of actions available to you on the Clients page.

To view your client list page, go to the main sidebar and click the Clients tab.

Overview
^^^^^^^^

The Clients page presents a list summary of all your current clients in a table format. The main elements of the table include:

- **Client:** The name of the client
- **Contact:** The name of the primary contact person
- **Email:** The client email address
- **Date Created:** The date the client was created
- **Last Login:** The date the client last logged in to the system
- **Balance:** The client’s payment balance
- **Action:** A range of actions you can take to manage activity relating to the selected client

Actions
^^^^^^^

To select an action for a particular client, hover with your mouse anywhere in the row entry of the client. A gray Select button will appear. Click on the Select arrow and a drop-down list will open.

When you click on an action, you will be automatically redirected to the relevant action page for the selected client. Here are the available actions in the drop-down list of the Action button, and the corresponding action pages that will open:

- **Edit Client** Edit the client’s details on the Clients / Edit page

Sorting & Filtering Clients

The sort and filter functions make it easy for you to manage and view your client information.

Sort the clients table via any of the following data columns: Client, Contact, Email, Date Created, Last Login, or Balance. To sort, click on the tab of your choice. A small arrow will appear. If the arrow is pointing up, data is sorted from lowest to highest value. If the arrow is pointing down, data is sorted from highest to lowest value. Click to change the arrow direction. (If you click on the Client, Contact or Email arrow, the data will be displayed in alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order.)

Filter the clients list by completing the Filter field, situated at the top right of the page, to the left of the gray Credits button. Clients can be filtered according to the client name, contact person name, or elements of the client name or contact person name. Here’s an example: Let’s filter the table for a client named “Joe Smith” of “Best Ninja” company. You can type “best ninja”, or “best” or “ninja”, or even “bes”, or “nin”, or “ja”, or “Joe”, “Smith”, “Jo” “oe”, “th” or any other grouping of letters in the client name or contact person name. The filter function will automatically locate and present all the relevant entries. This function makes it easy to find clients with even minimal input of information.

.. Tip: Need to search for a specific client in your Clients list? Start typing the first letters of the client's name and the filter will automatically present the relevant listings.


Archiving/Deleting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To archive or delete a specific client, hover over the client entry row, and open the Action drop-down list. Select Archive client or Delete client from the list. The Clients table will automatically refresh.

- **Deleted clients** are displayed with a strike through and a red Deleted label in the Action column.
- **Archived clients** are displayed with an orange Archived label in the Action column.

Note: You can also archive or delete one or more clients via the gray Archive button that appears at the top left side of the Clients table. To archive or delete clients, check the relevant clients in the check boxes that appear in the far left column next to the client name. Then click on the Archive button, open the drop-down list and select the desired action.

Want to view archived or deleted clients?
Click on the tag field located on the left top side of the screen, to the right of the gray Archive button. When you click on the field, a drop down menu will open, displaying all the filter tags: Active, Archived and Deleted. Select the tags you want, and the table will update automatically to display the filtered client list.


You can choose to restore or delete the archived client. To restore an archived client, hover with your mouse over the Action area for the relevant archived client. A gray Select button will appear. Click on the Select arrow, and choose Restore client from the drop-down list. To delete an archived client, select Delete client from the drop-down list of the Select button.

To restore a deleted client, hover with your mouse over the Action area for the relevant deleted client. A gray Select button will appear. Click on the Select arrow, and choose Restore client from the drop-down list.

Create Client
"""""""""""""

So, you’ve taken on a new client? Congratulations!

Your Clients list is at the heart of your invoicing activity, so it's really important to maintain current information on all your clients. When you start working with a new client, the first thing you’ll need to do is to add the new client by entering their contact information and business details.

When creating and saving a new client to your Clients list, make sure to have the relevant, up-to-date information at hand. You are only required to enter the information one time. Invoice Ninja automatically tracks all invoicing activity for each client.


**Let’s Begin**

To enter a new client, go to the Clients tab on the main sidebar, and click the + sign on the tab. This will open the Create Client page. Or, you can go to the Clients list page and click the blue New Client button at the top right side of the page.

The Create Client page is divided into four sections. Enter the information in the relevant fields.

.. Note: You don’t have to complete every field. Enter the information that is important or necessary for your needs.

Let’s take a closer look at each section:

- **Organization**: Enter details about your client’s business/company/organization, including the company name, ID number, VAT number, website address and telephone number.
- **Contacts**: Enter the name, email address and phone number of your contact person for this client. You can enter as many contact people as you like. To add more contact people, click +Add Contact.
- **Address**: Enter the street address of your client. This will be of particular importance if you need to send hard-copy invoices or payment receipts.
- **Additional Info**: Enter the payment currency, language, payment terms, company size (no. of employees), the relevant industry sector, public notes (these will appear on the invoice by default) and private notes (don’t worry - no one can see them but you.)

TIP: Understanding the Payment terms field – You may have different payment terms and agreements for various clients. Here, you can select the default due date for the specific client via the drop-down menu of the Payment terms field. The default due date is calculated according to the date on the invoice. For example, Net 0 means the payment is due on the date of the invoice; Net 7 means the payment is due 7 days after the date of the invoice, and so on. Note: Even if you choose default payment terms, you can always manually adjust an invoice payment due date for a specific invoice, via the Edit Invoice page.

Once you have filled in the page, click Save to save the new client information. From now on, when you click the Client field, the client’s name will appear in the drop down menu. Simply select the client you need and let the invoicing begin!

Client Overview Page
""""""""""""""""""""

Each client has its own Client Overview page. The overview page provides a complete summary of all your client details and activity in one page. From here, you can access everything you need about the specific client, including the client's general contact information, total standing payments and balance, and a detailed list of the client Activity, Invoices, Payments and Credits. You can also Edit, Archive or Delete the client, view the Client Statement and view the Client Portal, all directly from the Client Overview page. Let's explore:
