Invoice Design
==============

Whether you're a design novice or programming pro, Invoice Ninja gives you the power to customize your invoice design, to give your invoices the exact look you want. The design tool is the perfect way to match your invoices to your company's graphical look and feel, including colors, fonts, logos, margin sizes, column names, headers, footers and much more.

You can design you invoice using the simple selection tools, or go deeper and customize it from the foundations with our customization feature.

The Invoice Design page is divided into two sections. The top section presents the various options for customization and the bottom section displays a real time PDF sample of your invoice, so you can see your changes as you go along.

To customize the invoice design, there are five tabs to choose from. Let's go through them one by one:

General Settings
""""""""""""""""

Standard Design: Invoice Ninja provides a selection of design templates. Examples include 'Bold', 'Elegant', 'Hipster' and 'Business'. The default template setting is 'Clean'. To change the template setting, select a design from the drop down menu. The PDF invoice display below will automatically update to show you a preview of the design template.

Quote Design: You can also select a design template for your quotes. Choose from the available options in the drop down menu.
