API Tokens
==========

Invoice Ninja uses API tokens to enable access to third party providers, so you can streamline many of your invoicing and payments functions with our partners.

Tokens
""""""

The API Tokens page displays a table listing your current API tokens.

To add a new API token, click the blue Add Token + button at the top right of the page. The Tokens/ Create page will open.

Create Token
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enter the token name in the field and click the green Save button. A new token number will be automatically generated. You will then be redirected to the API Tokens page, where the new token will display in the table next to the relevant Name entry.

If you want to cancel the new entry before saving it, click the gray Cancel button.

Edit Token
^^^^^^^^^^

To edit an existing token, click on the gray Select button in the Action column of the API Tokens table, and a drop down menu will open. Select Edit Token from the menu, and the Tokens/ Edit page will open. You can now edit the token name. Click Save to apply the changes, or Cancel.

Archive Token
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To archive an existing token, click on the gray Select button in the Action column of the API Tokens table, and a drop down menu will open. Select Archive Token from the menu, and the token will automatically be sent to archives. It will no longer be viewable in the API Tokens table.
