Templates & Reminders
=====================

There are a few different emails your customers receive from you via the Invoice Ninja system as part of your invoicing communications. These include the invoice notification email, quote notification email, payment notification email and various reminder emails. You can customize all your emails by selecting a template, text and design, and by specifying the frequency of reminder emails.

Reminder Emails
"""""""""""""""

Sometimes, your clients need a friendly reminder about their outstanding payments. Invoice Ninja enables up to 3 reminder emails, and you can totally customize the email content and delivery schedule according to your preference.

You can create separate templates for the first, second and third reminder emails. To do so, click the relevant tab. The settings you choose will apply for that specific reminder email.

- **Schedule**: Define the schedule for the reminder email by selecting values for the three schedule boxes: the number of days after/ days before the due date/ invoice date. The reminder will be sent according to the values you select in these three fields.
- **Send Email**: If you want the reminder email to be sent automatically according to your defined schedule, check the Enable box. If you do not check Enable, no reminder email will be sent.
- **Late Fee Amount**: Specify a late fee amount to add to the invoice for overdue payments. You can add a different amount for each reminder email (i.e. you may want to increase the late fee with each late reminder email.)
- **Late Fee Percent**: Specify the late fee as a percentage of the invoice amount.
- **Subject**: Customize the subject line of your reminder email by entering the desired text.
