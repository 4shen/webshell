CARE Team
=========

Our Pledge
----------

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, the "Code of
Conduct Active Response Ensurers", or CARE team, pledge to ensure that the
spirit of the :doc:`Code of Conduct </contributing/code_of_conduct/index>`
is respected. Our main priority is to ensure the safety of our community members.
The second goal is to help educate the community as a whole to be aware of the
Code of Conduct and how to help implement its spirit throughout the community.
In case these goals conflict, we will prioritize safety of community members
over all other goals.

If you think there is or has been a violation to the Code of Conduct please contact
the CARE team or if you prefer contact only individual members of the CARE team.
