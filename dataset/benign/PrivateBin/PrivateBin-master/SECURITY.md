## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can send us email at security@privatebin.org. You should be able to get
a response within a week (usually during the next weekend). The respondee will
reply from their personal address and can offer you their GPG public key to
support end-to-end encrypted communication on sensitive topics or attachments.

You can also contact us via the regular issue tracker if the risk of early
publication is low or you would request input from other PrivateBin users.
