_Version 2, June 1991_
_Copyright © 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,_
_51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA_

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

### Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: **(1)** copyright the software, and
**(2)** offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

**0.** This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The “Program”, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a “work based on the Program”
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term “modification”.)  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

**1.** You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

**2.** You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

* **a)** You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
* **b)** You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.
* **c)** If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

**3.** You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

* **a)** Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
* **b)** Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,
* **c)** Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

**4.** You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

**5.** You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

**6.** Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

**7.** If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

**8.** If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

**9.** The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and “any
later version”, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

**10.** If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

### NO WARRANTY

**11.** BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

**12.** IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

been advised of the possibility of such damages.

#### 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor
grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

### Section 1 – Definitions.

a. __Adapted Material__ means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights
held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a
moving image.

b. __Adapter's License__ means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Public License.

c. __Copyright and Similar Rights__ means copyright and/or similar rights
closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance,
broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to
how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License,
the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

d. __Effective Technological Measures__ means those measures that, in the
absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December
20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

e. __Exceptions and Limitations__ means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

f. __Licensed Material__ means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

g. __Licensed Rights__ means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

h. __Licensor__ means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under
this Public License.

i. __Share__ means to provide material to the public by any means or process
that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

j. __Sui Generis Database Rights__ means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

k. __You__ means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

### Section 2 – Scope.

a. ___License grant.___

    1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
       hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
       non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
       Licensed Material to:

        A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

        B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

    2. __Exceptions and Limitations.__ For the avoidance of doubt, where
       Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does
       not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

    3. __Term.__ The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

    4. __Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.__ The Licensor
       authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats
       whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
       modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not
       to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
       modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
       technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
       Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making
       modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
       Material.

    5. __Downstream recipients.__

        A. __Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.__ Every recipient of
           the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
           Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
           conditions of this Public License.

        B. __No downstream restrictions.__ You may not offer or impose any
           additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
           Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing
           so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the
           Licensed Material.

    6. __No endorsement.__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
       construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use
       of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or
       granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive
       attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. ___Other rights.___

    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
       Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
       personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives
       and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
       limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,
       but not otherwise.

    2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

    3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
       royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
       directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable
       statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor
       expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

### Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

a. ___Attribution.___

    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

        A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
           Licensed Material:

            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any
               others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable
               manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
               designated);

            ii. a copyright notice;

            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
               reasonably practicable;

        B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an
           indication of any previous modifications; and

        C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,
           and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public
           License.

    2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
       manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
       Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
       conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
       the required information.

    3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
       required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

    4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You
       apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying
       with this Public License.

### Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
   reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of
   the database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
   database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
   which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
   is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
   substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your
obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other
Copyright and Similar Rights.

### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. __Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
   possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
   and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
   Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
   includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
   for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
   defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known
   or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or
   in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.__

b. __To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
   any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for
   any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
   exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this
   Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been
   advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where
   a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation
   may not apply to You.__

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall
   be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
   approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

### Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
   licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then
   Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
   6(a), it reinstates:

    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
       within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
    Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
    License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material
   under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material
   at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
   conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
   Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
   conditions of this Public License.

### Section 8 – Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
   interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of
   the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under
   this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
   unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it
   shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
   enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to
   comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
   limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to
   the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction
   or authority.
