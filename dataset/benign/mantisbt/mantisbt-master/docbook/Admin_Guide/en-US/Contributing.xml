    <title>Contributing to MantisBT</title>

    <section id="admin.contributing.develop">
        <title>Talent and Time</title>
	<para>
	     One of the greatest ways to contribute to MantisBT is to contribute
	     your talent and time. For MantisBT to keep growing we need such support
	     in all areas related to the software development cycle. This includes:
	     business analysts, developers, web designers, graphics designers,
	     technical writers, globalization developers, translators, testers,
	     super users, packagers and active users. If you would like to
	     contribute in any of these capacities please contact us through the
	     "Contact Us" page.

    <section id="admin.contributing.share">
        <title>Recommend MantisBT to Others</title>

        <para>
	    It feels great when we get feedback from the user community about
	    how MantisBT boosted their productivity, and benefited their organization.
	    A lot of the feedback I get is via email, some on mailing lists, and some
	    on forums. I would encourage such users to blog about it, tell their
	    friends about MantisBT, and recommend MantisBT to other organizations.
	    MantisBT is driven by it's community, the greater the community, the
	    greater the ideas, the greater of a product it becomes.

    <section id="admin.contributing.blog">
         <title>Blog about MantisBT</title>

         <para>
	     If you have a blog, then talk about MantisBT, review it's features
	     and help us spread the word.  A lot of users also like to blog
	     about how they customized MantisBT to fit their needs or to
	     integrate with other tools that they use in their work environment.

    <section id="admin.contributing.integrate">
        <title>Integrate with MantisBT</title>

        <para>
	    If you have a product that can be integrated with MantisBT to provide
	    value for MantisBT users, that would be a great place to contribute
	    and benefit both your project's and the MantisBT community.
	</para>
	<para>
	    A great example in this area are integrations with content management
	    systems (e.g. *Nuke, Xoops), project management (PHPProjekt), and
	    TestLink for Test Management. MantisBT can easily be integrated with
	    projects in any programming language whether it is hosted on the same
	    webserver or anywhere else in the world. This can be achieved through
	    its SOAP API and MantisConnect client libraries. MantisConnect comes
	    with client libraries and samples in languages like PHP, .NET, Java and
	    Cocoa.
